I googled the company’s name and there may be some legitimacy to this, has anyone gotten a call or further looked into it?

1npsbm5,Stolen Car,22,1758759041.0,"Hi everyone, I unfortunately got my car stolen in San Ysidro. Long story short, no cameras, no trackers, insurance won’t pay me out, shit out of luck. The police ran my plates and they say it didn’t go to Mexico (who knows though). My question is, is there a local known chop shop or place people sell these parts? It was 2018 fully loaded Honda civic so as you can imagine a very common car I am sure it is chopped already. I am not expecting to find it but I am just curious? I had some distinct car parts and I’m kinda being delusional that I can find them being sold. I don’t even care at about the car at this point I just wish the people would be stopped so it doesn’t happen again. Police told me hundreds of cars get stolen a day and they are very professional and organized. Any help or information is appreciated",25,sandiego

I always loved Corvette Diner growing up but the older I grew the more I noticed the quality of food go down. My favorite part was the experience and the birthday celebration they did. I am hoping to go somewhere where they make a big fun show of your birthday similar to Corvette Diner, and is family friendly as I have younger (picky eater) siblings. The group is 7 people in total.

I know Texas Roadhouse does something fun as well but the more options the better!!

1npwrj9,How to put a few hundred dollars (+ a few volunteers) to good use for those who are under-resourced in our community?,15,1758772180.0,"I have a few hundred dollars stashed away from birthdays and Christmas money received over the years. I wanted to do something special with it but was never sure what. Well, I finally decided that I really don't need to spend it on myself, so I'm looking for a local organization that is doing good work in the community where I could not only donate it, but preferably also volunteer in some capacity to carry out whatever I was funding. I'm sure I could find a few (or more) friends to join me if a few other bodies were needed.

An example of what I mean would be sponsoring a meal for the unhoused, then serving the meal with other volunteers. I know Jewish Family Services does this.

However, I would ideally like to sponsor something that would give someone the resources to better their life situation in a longer-term capacity than feeding them a single meal. I'm not sure of what all is out there, but maybe paying for materials for some sort of course or workshop could be an example?

Is anyone aware of any organizations or community groups that would be a good fit for what I'm looking for?

If it sparks any ideas, I'm passionate about helping immigrants, low-income and/or single-parent households, the unhoused, and also the natural environment. I'm a solopreneur so helping someone start a business in some way could also be cool since I'm in business for myself, too.

I know I'm not going to save anyone or change the world with this donation/volunteering, but this money is special to me in its own way so it would mean a lot to me to be able to use it in a meaningful way as I've described here. If it's an especially good fit, I'm also open to considering something that would turn into an ongoing volunteer engagement (though the funds would be a one-time thing).

Thank you in advance!",8,sandiego

1nqpl2f,San Diego Airport Valet is killing my EV battery with unauthorized driving,0,1758853218.0,"This is a warning to every EV driver thinking about leaving your car at San Diego International Airport’s Terminal 1 valet.

I left my Rivian R1S in valet 7 days ago. My GPS logs show the car has been driven multiple times without my authorization. Today, the battery is at 9% (I dropped it off at over 30%) and I haven’t even returned yet. By the time I get back Monday, it will likely be fully dead.

I’ve emailed and called the valet and the airport authority repeatedly. No one has responded. No explanation. No accountability. Just silence while they continue to run down my vehicle.

This isn’t “normal vampire drain.” This is unauthorized use. Twenty-one percent of my battery has been drained in a week, and my logs prove the car has been moved multiple times. That is theft of energy and unauthorized operation of my vehicle.

If you own an EV, do not trust San Diego Airport valet. You’re safer driving 90 minutes north and flying out of John Wayne/OC, because at least your vehicle won’t be abused while you’re away.

San Diego Airport: you owe every EV driver an explanation. You owe me an explanation. Stop ignoring calls and start addressing why your valet is treating customer vehicles like personal toys.

Teachers’ unions and civil rights groups warn that the legislation, which is purported to combat antisemitism, will stifle criticisms of Israel and its genocidal assault on Gaza.

AB 715 was introduced by Assembly members Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Hollywood) and Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay). The legislation would require lawmakers to appoint an “Antisemitism Coordinator” for the state. That coordinator would be able to review the curriculum, and threaten schools with fines and dismissals for refusing to remove material deemed “factually inaccurate.”

It would allow Israel supporters to file unsupported complaints of antisemitism with the California Department of Education.

The bill was recently passed in both chambers, but the process was fast-tracked, as there were only three days left in the legislative session. Multiple lawmakers said they weren’t given adequate time to assess it.",53,sandiego
