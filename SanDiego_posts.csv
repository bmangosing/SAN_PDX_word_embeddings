1npwrj9,How to put a few hundred dollars (+ a few volunteers) to good use for those who are under-resourced in our community?,13,1758772180.0,"I have a few hundred dollars stashed away from birthdays and Christmas money received over the years. I wanted to do something special with it but was never sure what. Well, I finally decided that I really don't need to spend it on myself, so I'm looking for a local organization that is doing good work in the community where I could not only donate it, but preferably also volunteer in some capacity to carry out whatever I was funding. I'm sure I could find a few (or more) friends to join me if a few other bodies were needed.

An example of what I mean would be sponsoring a meal for the unhoused, then serving the meal with other volunteers. I know Jewish Family Services does this.

However, I would ideally like to sponsor something that would give someone the resources to better their life situation in a longer-term capacity than feeding them a single meal. I'm not sure of what all is out there, but maybe paying for materials for some sort of course or workshop could be an example?

Is anyone aware of any organizations or community groups that would be a good fit for what I'm looking for?

If it sparks any ideas, I'm passionate about helping immigrants, low-income and/or single-parent households, the unhoused, and also the natural environment. I'm a solopreneur so helping someone start a business in some way could also be cool since I'm in business for myself, too.

I know I'm not going to save anyone or change the world with this donation/volunteering, but this money is special to me in its own way so it would mean a lot to me to be able to use it in a meaningful way as I've described here. If it's an especially good fit, I'm also open to considering something that would turn into an ongoing volunteer engagement (though the funds would be a one-time thing).

Thank you in advance!",3,SanDiego

I got a fix-it ticket for two burned out tail lights. I fixed them and went to the local sheriff's office to have the fix approved. Since I don't want to drive to Vista, they told me to call Vista Traffic Court to find out how much to send them by mail. 1) they only answer the GD phone from 8:30am to 11:30am. WTF IS THAT?!? 2) the recorded message said to go to their website www.sdcourt.ca.gov. The only thing I can find online there is to pay the full fine of $193. I was under the impression the fixed tail lights would be cheaper than that. Plus, the wording online appears that I am paying a full fee without contest or something.

So I pulled back around and took a video and pictures of them. I don’t know who they are, but I talked to the mini mall’s private security, who said they had already contacted law-enforcement.

I do a lot of fabricating as well, I'd say it's a 50/50 mix. Over the last 3 months, I have put out over 85 applications, and yet almost none are being viewed or even getting back to me.

I have also applied to the local 206 for their apprenticeship program. Their test is in October, but yet it's a lengthy process to get in, and I'm not even sure I'll get in. So I need help. If anybody knows of any place actively hiring, I'd be happy to give a hand. I don't mind commuting any distance; and I don't mind any shift. Day, mid or night I'll do anything.

They are getting washed 2x a week with flea shampoo, bought those expensive ointments that you put once a month, and they just won’t leave. 

I talked to my mom and she’s been dealing with the same thing with her dog. She takes her dog to the vet in TJ and apparently, the vet said that there’s some sort of super flea going on because lots of people are bringing their cats/dogs for flea treatments that seem to be resistant to everything. 

I’m taking my cats to the vet tomorrow to get a vaccine they’ve gotten before for fleas, and just going to continue on with bathing them.

I go to UCSD but the campus gyms are always packed, so I’m considering getting a membership elsewhere. If your apartment has a gym, that could be a great option too. I’m mainly focused on cardio (treadmill, cycling, running/jogging) with a mix of strength training.

Outside the gym, I’d also love to team up on meal planning and help keep each other consistent. If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, feel free to DM.

This is especially for you folks that are long-term renters, paying below market, in units where the original owners sell due to age, and the developers out there hungrily looking for these older apartment complexes to evict you, paint the walls and re-rent for 100%+ more. They cannot just kick you out. 

Please look at your rights. San Diego's tenant protections are only in the actual metro of SD. 

California has its own protections that are pro tenant, but San Fran, LA and finally SD build upon the state's laws and enact greater protections. 

Im not going to debate the merits of the law.  Not going to get into the downside or upside of these laws. You all want to debate the pros and cons here- please feel free to have discourse/debates/fights about the protections. 

Im just here to say if you are a renter and in any way losing your place through no fault of your own- look at our laws that were enacted in June of 2023.

Should someone have something valid and want to speak to a lawyer please call around and get any and all free consultations you can and go from there

Rent for a *basic* one-bedroom in North Park or Normal Heights is pushing $2,200+, gas hovers around $5, groceries are insane, and parking tickets feel like a tax for existing. I make decent money on paper (around $65k), but it feels like I’m just surviving, not living.

What makes it worse is that even when you’re responsible, this city still punishes you. I had one late rent payment last year when I was between jobs, literally 12 days late, and it tanked my credit. Now, even though I’ve never missed a payment since, landlords want to treat me like I’m a liability. I’ve been asked for 2 months’ rent upfront *plus* a cosigner for an apartment that’s barely bigger than a closet. I have literally no idea how to build my credit score back again.

I love the weather, the beaches, the food, all of that’s amazing. But honestly, what’s the point if you’re constantly stressing about money? I can’t be the only one wondering if San Diego is really worth it anymore.

Edit: I get it. I really get it, that $65k is not enough to live here and I'm trying my best to get that number up. But some things are out of my hand which wont let me move out. For the credit score part, some good folks DMed debit cards that report to credit bureaus like Fizz and Chime. I'll look into them give a try.

My understanding is that since the amount of surplus kwh is actually the same though, the amount of compensation I’d get back is the same for either plan, right? So my conclusion is that for me it wouldn’t make sense to switch.

# Example Written Comment

My name is \_\_\_ and I live in \_\_\_. I oppose SDGE’s hydrogen blending project because it puts our health and safety at risk, passes unnecessary costs onto ratepayers, and delays the transition to clean electric buildings. I urge the CPUC to cancel this project and support proven solutions like electrification, rooftop solar, and storage. Thank you.

**2.** **For greater impact** **Speak In-Person at the Public Hearing**

* **Date:** Friday, September 26, 2025  
* **Times:** 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm  
* [RSVP HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZgZXJsXIVxsAKGee5bD7QLPvrJSWVO9jGPubRVJ6tDTv4HA/viewform?usp=header)
* **Location:** United Way of San Diego, County Conference Room 100A, 4699 Murphy Canyon Rd, San Diego, CA 92123

Sign up at the Public Advisor’s table when you arrive. Remarks are limited to 1 minute.

# Why This Project Is Wrong for San Diego

* **Minimal climate benefit:** Experts agree hydrogen blending does little to cut emissions.
* **Higher risks:** Hydrogen is more explosive than natural gas, leaks more easily, and produces more lung-damaging NOx. The American Medical Association formally opposes hydrogen blending in homes and buildings.  
* **Ratepayer burden:** SDGE is asking the CPUC to charge us $21 million for an experiment that benefits their bottom line, not the public.  
* **Better alternatives exist:** Local rooftop solar, battery storage, and full electrification are safer, cheaper, and available now.  

Even without hydrogen, gas appliances already pollute our homes. Studies from Stanford and Harvard link gas stoves to asthma, cancer risks, and benzene exposure equivalent to secondhand smoke. Blending hydrogen only makes things worse.

This is a **dangerous, expensive, and unnecessary project.** San Diego should not be a test site for risky fossil fuel experiments.

# Talking Points for Comments

* I oppose SDGE’s hydrogen blending demonstration project.  
* We need to transition off gas — not prolong it with dangerous hydrogen experiments.  
* The American Medical Association opposes hydrogen blending due to explosion risks and harmful NOx emissions.  
* San Diego should invest in electrification, rooftop solar, and storage instead.  
* This project is a cash grab — San Diegans should not be forced to pay $21 million to boost SDGE’s monopoly profits.
* These hearings prove why we need **Public Power**: an energy system that puts people and the planet before profit.

**Thank you for speaking up. Together, we can protect San Diego from SDGE’s profiteering and push for a truly clean, people-powered energy future.**",32,SanDiego

1nnu01k,"Looking to Borrow a Compatible Ryzen CPU (for BIOS update) – Long Shot, But Worth Asking",5,1758564692.0,"Hey all,

I’ve run into a snag with my build and figured I’d throw this out there to see if anyone local might be able to help.

I’ve got an ASUS TUF Gaming X570-Plus WiFi motherboard and a Ryzen 7 5800X CPU. Problem is, the board doesn’t have BIOS FlashBack, and my BIOS is too old to recognize the 5800X — so the system powers on, but won’t POST.

To update the BIOS, I need a compatible CPU that will actually boot on this board. That means anything from the Ryzen 3000 series (e.g., 3600, 3700X, etc.) should work. I don’t need to keep it, I’d just like to borrow it long enough to flash the BIOS.

I know it’s a long shot, but if anyone nearby has a spare chip that works with X570 they’d be willing to lend or let me test with, I’d really appreciate it. Happy to provide collateral, meet in public, or work out whatever makes you comfortable.

Thanks in advance!",13,SanDiego

Whether of not, it was dumping DDT,  industrial or military ""waste"" in the bay or offshore there's people that will continue to do these things.

They used to live among the kelp forests that we've all but destroyed... along with the abalone (snails) that got plundered and all but wiped out.

It's important that we try to work to restore these things... tourists come here and admire what we have naturally and want to try to exploit it like they have where they've come from and destroyed everything.. now they want to move here and do the same not realizing how much more there used to be and what we have is a fraction of what it was like here.

1nmorns,Shipping Motorcycle from Hawaii to California after frame swap,0,1758451481.0,"Hello,

I’m in kind of a tricky situation and wanted some advice.

- I’m a college student in California, but my bike (2025 Yamaha R7) is still in Hawaii.

- The OEM frame got swapped out for an aftermarket reinforced steel frame. The new frame has a legit VIN and MCO.

- Pasha (the shipper) says they need active registration or temporary registration, which I assume is a California temporary operating permit, one-trip permit. I don’t believe that Hawaii offers temporary registration.

Pasha: “To ship a vehicle from Hawaii, we will need a current registration. That registration does not have to be from Hawaii, and we can accept temporary registration as long as it is valid at the time of shipment.”

- Ideally, I’d rather just ship the bike as-is with the new VIN + MCO, then do the full registration in California. I do NOT want to deal with the whole safety and reregistering in Hawaii, just to have to redo it in California 😭

My questions:
 1.	Has anyone shipped a motorcycle with only an MCO (no active registration)?
 2.	Does California DMV allow you to register a bike with a new frame VIN/MCO straight from out-of-state?
 3.	Is there a way to bypass having to re-register in Hawaii?
 4. What does Pasha mean by “temporary registration?” Will Pasha allow a temp operating permit/one-trip permit?

Thanks.

ABC acquiesced to that pressure from affiliate networks Nextstar and Sinclair by removing Kimmel’s show indefinitely. This is direct action from the FCC, federal government, and Prez to suppress free speech, in direct violation with the first amendment. Be clear; The Director of the FCC knew what he was saying—he is a skilled government tactician who wrote the FCC chapter of Project 2025 (starts on p845, if you're looking for a good time). 

**Taking action:** This crap seems hopeless sometimes, but the affiliate networks have one huge vulnerability: they cannot survive without advertisers. So, to take action, your best bet is to applying pressure to advertisers who support the affiliate stations. In San Diego, **KSWB FOX 5 and KUSI** are [owned by Nextstar](https://www.nexstar.tv/stations/). There are no Sinclair stations in San Diego. 

**A quick call, email, google review, yelp review, or other message works:**

Your ad dollars are going to a station owned by Nexstar, the network that is suppressing free speech.

As a mod here I can't tell you about how difficult it is, to have a parent or grandparent be lost and the delay cause by the families NOT having all their info available and ready for a search.  Then to find out that the delay resulted in that missing persons passing.

1nlq9nr,Downtown San Diego isnt for you,780,1758347639.0,"a rant

just say that. why all the hating? 

I see these posts about downtown, and the majority of it is from people who lived here a decade to go or who only visit for games and events and have the most to say as if where they live is perfect

I've seen more Padres fans and drunk people from bars pissing on the streets than I ever have from a homeless person. Y'all come down here and piss everywhere and trash the place litter like unbelievably, and then get on the Internet and talk about how terrible it is to be here

Is there a lot of homeless people? Yeah 
Do they bother people the way Reddit likes to say they do? No 

I watch the local news and in the last three years I've not seen one story about a homeless person attacking anybody it's always somebody who's drunk and fighting or something similar. Not saying it doesn't happen, but it's not happening at the rate everybody likes to believe it is

I live here and I am walking my dogs about three hours a day throughout the day and evening in total I am on foot around my neighborhood all day long I see and hear most everything and it is nowhere near as dramatic as people make it.

I've seen more women harassed by men at the bars or on the street corners waiting for Ubers or whatever than I ever have from a homeless person 

But somebody will take one story from 20 years ago and run with it until the end of time   

Y'all really act as if Hillcreast is any safer. Hillcreast is crawling with meth addicts

downtown living is a lifestyle. If you're not built for it, just say so. Stay up in your boring suburbs where you have to drive every single place you go spending a lot of money in gas and parking and everything else.

There's plenty of advantages of living in downtown San Diego.  

*Still 15 minutes from numerous beaches. 

*Can go to all the Padres games and events and whatever and never worry about parking

*The only place you need to drive to is the dispensary, which can be delivered 

*if you are a drinker you can party until your heart's content and not to worry about an expensive Uber, late night train ride or driving Drunk to get home

i'm not here to convince anybody to live in downtown but I am getting annoyed at the rhetoric about how unsafe and how unclean it is when I see with with my own two eyes every day the safety and the clean issues not coming from the homeless be coming from people who visit here for events and then trash it and then leave 

Downtown San Diego is not meant to be like other downtowns in most cities. It's San Diego. Nobody is moving here to be in downtown. People move to San Diego for the beach and the weather and things like that which can be had from most neighborhoods around the county

I was here as a kid, but ended up moving and grew up in New York City and I lived in Los Angeles for over a decade so I've been to many downtown areas and this one? Is a fucking daycare comparatively speaking. If you can't handle downtown San Diego if it's so scary and so sketchy then you probably should never visit another downtown and any other major city on a coast

also everyone acts like downtown is strictly gaslamp and East Village. There is Little Italy, Cortez Hill, Balboa, Marina District, bankers hill etc those neighborhoods are ALL downtown san diego. 

if you don't like it so much or if it's so bad just stay your ass home. Stop going to the Padres games when that happens maybe they'll clean it up more to your liking 

and no I have nothing better to do right now than to give you a word salad rant about people's shitty takes on downtown ",468,SanDiego

1nli6e1,Dermatologist in SD that can help me with a scar,10,1758322902.0,"I am scarred (literally and figuratively) from a dermatologist in El Cajon that sliced off a mole of mine without asking. This was about a year ago and i don’t even think he’s practicing anymore. If he was I would beg him to stop. But I won’t go into the dirty details of this awful appointment besides the fact that his “biopsy” i.e. slicing off a mole of mine and then never even calling me to tell me the results of said biopsy left its mark on me. He did not tell me that the biopsy meant cutting it off btw. I assumed it was scraping a few cells or something. A little communication would have gone a long way. 

Do doctors get paid per mole removal? He tried to convince me to cut off a bunch of them—none cancerous btw. I literally was only there to get screened for skin cancer. Now I have this raised puffy scar on my shoulder where he removed my mole. I thought it would heal flat but it looks like someone put a cigarette out on me. It’s big and pinkish purple. I actually cry about it sometimes because it just used to be a cute flat mole and now it’s a lump of unsightly scar tissue. I haven’t dealt with it because I’m worried about just getting another shitty dermatologist trigger happy with a scalpel. But it makes me actively upset because it’s very obvious (I live in tank tops). 

Does anyone know a dermatologist that specializes in scar stuff? Ideally getting it to flatten out or something? I can’t even tattoo over this to disguise it. I’ve considered going full gen z and putting those pimple patches on it just to not have to look at it but it’s too damn big. I have sharp health care, ideally somewhere that will that that. Reaching out in a moment of desperation because I’m so mad at myself for letting this freaky old man cut off a part of my body for nothing. Need a happier ending.

In 2021 I moved to Miami (Brickell) and I remember the first thing that stood out to me was how clean and active it was compared to DTSD. At any given time of day the streets are bustling - people walking dogs, exercising, going out to eat, or to work. Brickell completely revived downtown Miami over the past few years with just the right mix of jobs, people, restaurants, and even a shopping mall that's always packed

Now when I visit downtown San Diego it feels like a ghost town. There's no one out during the day south of Broadway because there's no jobs. There's no shopping (we know about Horton Plaza) and it just feels like there's no reason to be in downtown unless you party - at night the streets come alive. 

I know SD has more neighborhoods to offer than just DT, more than other major cities, but what's crazy is that the condos in DT hold their value and it keeps getting prohibitively more expensive. Yet the people that live here don't go out in the day. 

After experiencing other downtowns more its weird to me. I hope the Horton Plaza office project gets picked back up and can revitalize DT with young professionals to bring more life to it during the day.",218,SanDiego

This exists in other places. They exist in Denver, Houston, Germany, UK, etc. I’m sure elsewhere in the US. I don’t want a Dave & Busters. Usually called. Biergarten, Bierhaus, beer garden. A food hall.

The new Olive Street Park sort of has this being next to Communal Coffee. Izola downtown off Faultline Park downtown almost does. Station Tavern in South Park is decent. Stone at Liberty Station sort of meets the mark but every time I’ve gone the vibe seems more like business meeting or weekend brunch than family hangout.

1nkt7bs,SD Humane Society Employs Pro Do Euthanasia Enthusiast as Assistant Director of Animal Shelter,0,1758253539.0,"I apologize for my mistake about the SD Humane Society and have corrected it in this edited post but do not know how to change the title. Any help in that area would be appreciated.

I was appalled to learn that the assistant director of Animal control, who works for the San Diego County Department of Animal Services has been promoting mass euthanasia of dogs, raising the rate of killings skyward and believes even more killings should occur. Her name is Rachael Borelli and employing her means the SD County Department  of Animal Services is advocating that more and more dogs should be killed. 

One woman reported she had to return a dog because her other dog wouldn't accept him. She reported he was a great dog and was assured he would not be euthanized. Rachael Borelli signed his euthanasia forms and had him killed soon after the woman left the building. The next day, she decided she would try to find another way to keep the dog and came back for him, but of course, he had already been killed.

A kind soul on reddit explained my mistake in believing that this Department, like other SD Animal Control Departments, was directly controlled by the SD Humane Society. I humbly Apologize for my mistake. The kind Reddit person instead thoughtfully directed me to the SDCounty Department of Animal Services. I have been unable to find any way to complain to them directly but have sent a query to their general contact email: dasinfo@sdcounty.ca.gov

If anyone knows a better contact info, I would appreciate the information.

Knowing this, it is difficult to understand how the County of San Diego, who asks for public donations on their Animal Services webpage,  could be so inhumane as to allow this terrible woman to even work for Animal Control, let alone employ her as the assistant director of Animal Control, which in her eyes means Animal Murder. One of her workers was so fed up she became a whistle blower,  releasing a voicemail where Borelli was swearing and advocating for even more dog deaths. Two other employess who left their jobs said that they were not surprised by the viocemail message.

Fortunately, this was reported on KPBS. I hope anyone who reads this will join me in complaining. If enough of us care, and take just 5 minutes to email a complaint, we can make a difference and save dog lives. It is a free and takes just a small amount of time

I am a Journalism student at San Diego State University and I am writing an article for a class about the unemployment rate in San Diego and what it looks like. I'm looking to speak to people who are either currently unemployed or those who were unemployed and what their struggles were. I'm looking to have a short conversation about what are/were your struggles on looking for jobs, your personal experience on looking at hiring applications, what hiring managers told you if you were turned down on a job offer, your view on the job market in San Diego, etc. The questions may change over time, but just to give you an idea, those are some questions that are related to what I'm talking about.

Disclaimer, my story will NOT be public. It will not be published by some news organization. It will be published on my personal blog that I created in my Digital Journalism class, therefore no one will see it except for those who have the link to my blog. I hoping to speak to at least 2 people who are comfortable to share their experience on being unemployed or who were unemployed and talk about their view on San Diego's job market and the unemployment rate. My story is due on October 27 so I would need to speak with a few people before that date. If you are willing to talk with me, please message me privately here on Reddit. If you know anyone else who's willing to share their thoughts, refer them to me or comment below.

I need to sell two cars. One is a 2015Fiat 500e and the other is a 2001 BMW Z3 Roadster. Both in great shape. Here are my questions for those that might have more knowledge about the process.

1) How do I ensure I don't get scammed? Have we gotten to a point where the only options are cash or drawing a cashier's check in person? I'm assuming none of the electronic payment methods are safe due to the possibility of hacked accounts and stolen credit cards.

2) I plan to use a Bill of Sale stating the sale is ""as is"" and final. I will also fill out the pink slip and file the necessary NRL on the DMV website. But this is where it gets weird. The NRL is supposed to document that I I have sold the car and are no longer liable. However, the DMV website says that it will still be in my name until the buyer registers it. I've heard horror stories about the buyer never registering it and the seller getting tickets (and worse) months later.

There’s a letter circulating around within employees… this move is costing more than what it would have cost to simply extend the leases. I’m debating whether or not to send the letter to all of the news sources and make this public. The City has failed its employees once again. ",6,SanDiego

They have little to NO emissions equipment. Too often belching over-rich mixtures from a.lack of maintenance or equipment. Sitting behind these vehicles in traffic makes your eyes burn and can give you a head ache. They NEVER get pulled over (for emissions). I had a chance once to speak off the record with a career CA Highway Patrol Officer (remember haters this is just one guy...) and asked about this issue. He told me if he pulls me over and issues a citation, there is a good chance I will show up on the court date and either pay the fine, fix the car or both.

Long Version:
I get together with a few friends from Clairemont and Poway area about once a month to eat and talk. We found one restaurant where you order at the counter and then seat yourself on a large patio. Because there are no servers, it doesn't feel wrong to stay at the table and talk for a long time. We tip the employees at the counter up front and there is always plenty of space around us for customers coming and going. If you know any restaurants like this in San Diego county, preferably near or between Clairemont and Poway, I would love to know about them! It would be nice to not always go to the same spot.

1ni07zj,Dear Starbucks Employee: Thanks For Taking Care of My Mom,326,1757975290.0,"I've had a long day. Month. Year.

My mom drove 100+ miles from up north to take me to a VA Appointment. Long story short. A lot of sleep issues and a broken rib.

After the appointment I asked her to take me to Target (Sports Arena) so I could pick up a med in the pharmacy. My mom was quite excited to go to Target after she found out it had a Starbucks inside (I guess she hadn't had her fix yet). After I was done at the pharmacy I went to the Starbucks to catch up with her. This is when I learned that she left her wallet somewhere (perhaps in the car, back home, my home). Anyway, you told her not to her worry about it and that you would take care it.

I heard about other apartments in San Diego having a mold issues so I'm wondering---

Apartment is Eaves in Rancho Penasquitos, San Diego 

She just moved into a new apartment and when she moved in everything seemed fine until she turned on the bathroom vent and left it on for a few hours. She came back to a HUGE amount of debris and dust shooting out of the vent and it sprinkled all over her bathroom.

It's been 2 weeks and now she has been having a constant cough and sore throat, but only when's in her apartment.

Maintenance came in and ""cleaned"" the bathroom vent. Every morning she wakes up with a really sore throat and cough, so she had maintenence check her bedroom HVAC. They said it was just from having the air pointed at her, but since then, no changes and the sore throat and cough is still the same.

She tried leaving the window open and and a humidifier, but the cough and sore throat is STILL bad and only when she runs the HVAC fan or AC. When she leaves the apartment, the sore throat starts going away. 

She put another maintenance request in to check the vents so this is now the 3rd time since she moved in 2 weeks.
I advised having an inspection for mold and possibly seeing a doctor. 

Any legal advice, or medical advice for her?",1,SanDiego

The main ongoing series didn’t quite capture certain landmarks, but comics artist and writer Adam Warren really went above and beyond with a few of his mini-series featuring the characters.

Focusing on the characters Grunge (it was the 90’s!) and Roxy “Freefall” Spaulding, his works utilized his anime-stylings in a few familiar settings.

I remember being shocked when the first issue of the Gen 13 Bootleg Series’ “Grunge The Movie” storyline, had the characters seeing a Hong Kong Film Festival at what appears to be the Mission Valley 20, let alone he captures the nuances of the mall during that time.

Shortly afterwards, Warren’s three-issue “Magical Drama Queen Roxy” showcased a few other familiar locales, such as the Hard Rock Cafe that was located down by the La Jolla Shores, let alone a visit Roxy makes to “The Mall of Doom,” borrows some imagery from ol’ Horton Plaza.  Also of note, the characters go into what appears to be tue Sam Goody at Horton too. I remember, because the one entrance had people stepping down a few steps into the main lower-level area!

Edit: WOW did people wildly understand this post. 1. I’m totally cool with horses on the beach and horses in general. 2. This wasn’t a local or a jockey taking their horses to the beach. This was a bunch of rednecks that parked their horse trailer at the beach so they could get a photo shoot, looked like they were from Arizona. 3. It’s a fucking off leash dog beach and they walked the horses directly into the crowd of dogs causing trouble. 4. There’s THOUSANDS of miles of accessible beach and they chose this one, just not a smart choice in my opinion.

My grandma had a masters in cultural music and would play classics on the piano like yankee doodle. Grandpa played the harmonica and had a small wooden man which he would hold over a board and thumb the board to make it ""dance"" to the music. It was a big stop for kids and field trips (i once rode along with a local school and got to see them perform).

I'm just hoping that in the 30 years of them doing this, and all the times people had cameras out for their performance, someone out there might have a recording i could have to show my dad, wife, and kids.

   * General = 3 VA/ft² × 810 = 2,430 VA
   * SABCs = 3 × 1,500 = 4,500 VA
   * Laundry = 1 × 1,500 = 1,500 VA
   * Range (Table 220.55, 1 range) = 8,000 VA (will verify nameplate)
   * Radiant ceiling heat (two zones): • If using measured totals: 3,400 + 2,400 = **5,800 VA** • If using circuit max: 2 × (20 A × 208 V) = **8,320 VA**
* → **Totals before demand** • With 5,800 VA heat: **22,230 VA** • With 8,320 VA heat: **24,750 VA**→ **Demand per 220.83(A): 8,000 + 40% of remainder** • 22,230 VA → **13,692 VA ≈ 65.9 A @ 208 V** • 24,750 VA → **14,700 VA ≈ 70.7 A @ 208 V**
* (For context only) 220.82 Optional ≈ 100–105 A here, but that method requires ≥100 A feeders, so I’m not using it to justify the existing 90 A.

**My Questions:**

1. What’s a realistic cost/effort in San Diego for a **retroactive permit** on a condo subpanel?
2. For a 90 A feeder, will DSD/inspection accept a **220.83(A)** calc at \~66–71 A (depending on heat nameplate), or push for a service/feeder upgrade?
3. Any gotchas with #2 AL feeders at \~200 ft (voltage-drop expectations for a typical condo load)?
4. Recommendations for local electricians familiar with **multi-family** and **retro permits** who can shepherd this through?
5. I’m planning an EVSE later, would it be better to permit panel now and EVSE later, or combine them?

I know DIY + unpermitted isn’t ideal, but the Zinsco was a legitimate fire hazard. Looking for practical advice on making this right with the city. Thanks in advance for any insights from those familiar with San Diego multi-family requirements.",1,SanDiego

Teachers’ unions and civil rights groups warn that the legislation, which is purported to combat antisemitism, will stifle criticisms of Israel and its genocidal assault on Gaza.

AB 715 was introduced by Assembly members Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Hollywood) and Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay). The legislation would require lawmakers to appoint an “Antisemitism Coordinator” for the state. That coordinator would be able to review the curriculum, and threaten schools with fines and dismissals for refusing to remove material deemed “factually inaccurate.”

It would allow Israel supporters to file unsupported complaints of antisemitism with the California Department of Education.

I left my Rivian R1S in valet 7 days ago. My GPS logs show the car has been driven multiple times without my authorization. Today, the battery is at 9% (I dropped it off at over 30%) and I haven’t even returned yet. By the time I get back Monday, it will likely be fully dead.

I’ve emailed and called the valet and the airport authority repeatedly. No one has responded. No explanation. No accountability. Just silence while they continue to run down my vehicle.

This isn’t “normal vampire drain.” This is unauthorized use. Twenty-one percent of my battery has been drained in a week, and my logs prove the car has been moved multiple times. That is theft of energy and unauthorized operation of my vehicle.

If you own an EV, do not trust San Diego Airport valet. You’re safer driving 90 minutes north and flying out of John Wayne/OC, because at least your vehicle won’t be abused while you’re away.

San Diego Airport: you owe every EV driver an explanation. You owe me an explanation. Stop ignoring calls and start addressing why your valet is treating customer vehicles like personal toys.

I want to post pictures (56 in total over a period of 2 days) where a car could have fit if people didn’t park selfish. Why would you leave 6ft in front of you or behind you? I understand sometimes it’s to get out safely but if you’re the first car after the red marker, it’s just being a terrible person. 

Made some new friends at a meet and talked about this exact same thing and ranted with them and when we decided to go to a different place, this person did the exact same thing we both ranted about (parked terribly/selfishly) - confused Pikachu face.

So I’d like this to serve as a gentle but FIRM reminder— Im sure your dog is sweet as pie, mine isn’t and we don’t want to be approached!

A public space is not your backyard. The entitlement of some of these owners is so baffling and quite frightening.

Please keep us safe in these beautiful public parks! Please keep you and your dog safe by leashing up! (If your dog’s recall is 100, y’all are amazing and this isn’t about you)

I wish dog owners would realise if a dog is on a lead there is a reason. Stop letting your dogs run over to a dog on a lead and saying hes friendly!! It is so stressful for a reactive dog owner!

1ntwbon,Job Market Really Sucks,32,1759185407.0,"The job market here sucks right now, it's so brutal. I've been trying to get clinical hours so I can apply to PA school, but I swear it feels impossible.

All the ""entry-level"" healthcare jobs I find require certifications that I don't have. Every training program start date is weeks away and I feel like I've been in a frustrating cycle of rejections and ghostings

I'm honestly so discouraged. I know I want to become a PA, but I feel like I can't even get my foot in the door.

Can anyone let me know how they got their foot in? Or recommend any training programs that they took? Any realistic/practical advice would mean a lot. Thanks:)",10,SanDiego

I called the one near where the old Fry's electronics used to be, to see about getting my dog in... she injured and may have broken a toe or more at the dog park (she can't walk on her paw a day later). My dog has a Banfield Optimum Wellness Plan and has had it for 9 years. 

So I called, and was immediately put on hold for 15 minutes. Then, I explained the situation and was immediately told ""we can't see her today., take her to another hospital or urgent care (note: those don't honor the wellness plans)"". I asked whether there was a supervisor I could talk to... Another long hold then"" she can't talk to you until Thursday"". That's 4 days from now.

1nt60yb,Dental Cleaning Opportunity,0,1759111168.0,"Hi everyone,

My name is Grace, and I'm a senior dental hygiene student at Concorde College, located near National City. I am seeking patients who have not been to the dentist in a few to many years, need a deep cleaning (SRP) and have moderate to heavy amount of plaque. I am seeking ages 18-60+ and someone with a condition such as diabetes, hypertension, etc.

No insurance is required. Adults pay a one-time fee of just $20, which covers all services for an entire calendar year. Services include x-rays/panos, sealants, oral cancer screenings, and more. All treatments are supervised by licensed dentists and registered dental hygienists, ensuring you receive professional care.

Please note: Our dental hygiene clinic operates as a learning environment with licensed professionals supervising all treatments I would provide you with. This ensures your care will be completed with high attention to detail; however, it will require longer appointments and usually more than one appointment to complete. It’s a great opportunity if you’re willing to be patient throughout the process, as dental care can be quite expensive.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Kind regards, Grace ",0,SanDiego

He says he's happy with his social situation, but I'm not so sure.  His friends at school are the adults he interacts with, such as his IEP support person and the young adults that run the after-school program.

I'd really like to arrange some playdates with kids around his age.  I'm thinking we could meet up at a park with a playground.  It might be better if it's a smaller, neighborhood park so that there isn't a big crowd of children to distract my kid or yours.  

A little about my boy:  10 years old.  Fifth grade.  Very smart.  He's on the autism spectrum, but he has lower support needs.  He's not very sporty.  He's interested in Five Nights at Freddies, Minecraft, and YouTube brain rot.

1ntq56x,The Digital Coupon Ordinance goes into Effect October 1st: Email from Vons,11,1759171072.0,"""Dear Valued Customer,

We want to inform you about a new city ordinance that may affect your shopping experience at our 29 City of San Diego stores.

Beginning October 1, 2025, the City of San Diego’s Digital Coupon Ordinance, also known as the Grocery Pricing Transparency law, will go into effect. This ordinance requires that any digital discount offered to customers (other than personalized loyalty deals) must also be available in a non-digital format to provide equal access for all customers, including those who may not use smartphones or apps.

Since many of our deals are sponsored and supported by manufacturers, cooperation with our vendors is necessary. Unfortunately, as of today, some vendors and manufacturers have not provided alternative formats for their digital offers resulting in a reduced number of promotions and digital deals available in the impacted San Diego stores. The addresses of the impacted stores are provided for your reference [here](https://www.vons.com/content/dam/docs/san-diego-coupon-ordinance-impacted-stores-use.pdf).

We understand this may be disappointing and are actively working with our vendor partners to explore solutions that maintain the value and savings you expect.

Thank you for your understanding and continued loyalty. If you have any questions or need assistance accessing available offers, our store teams are here to help.

Sincerely,

Vons""",18,SanDiegan
1ntpv12,Vons Response to San Diego Grocery Ordinance,53,1759170443.0,"Today, Vons sent an email saying that, in order to comply with the San Diego grocery ordinance, that all coupons must be offered in paper format, and that the manufacturers they partner with don't do that (or haven't had the time to adapt to it), so a subset of coupons (digital manufacturer coupons) we otherwise would have been getting, we now won't. At the time, this was something I said could happen as a result of city council actions, and it has.

This seems to differ from Ralphs. To my understanding, Ralphs will still offer digital manufacturer coupons in its app and on the website. I am unsure about other grocery retailers. Local grocery retailers seem to differ in their exact interpretation of compliance, in reasonable ways. Ralphs and Food 4 Less have a scan sheet for the weekly digital deals, which are store coupons.

On the large, I'd say there are more mfr coupons than store coupons in the app. Maybe 1-2 dozen of them are store coupons: the best deals of the week. The long tail of them are mfr coupons.

So, I would say if you're planning on doing deals involving mfr coupons, that you are better off avoiding Albertsons and affiliates (Vons/Albertsons/Pavilions) until things change.",36,SanDiegan
1ntnofk,Thanks for ruining my day off,218,1759165546.0,"I was having a nice morning off work riding my bike down El Cajon Blvd to go the zoo a bit after 9am.  Traffic was light since most people are already at work. 

I was riding in the right most lane where there are sharrows painted intermittently in the road to signal to cyclists where to bike to avoid getting doored and to signal to cars to watch out for cyclists. 

All of a sudden some jabroni comes up behind me and lays on his horn. So I honk mine and signal him to go around because the other lanes were completely clear. He continued to honk at me so I got over to the other lane since he seemed like he just wouldn’t let up. We wound up at a red light so I was next to him, having switched lanes. 

I’ve been trying not to engage with these fuckers because people are crazy but I’ve had a stressful couple of months so I’m just like “WHAT?!” at his window. He rolls his window down and yells “Are you trying to fucking die you CUNT? GET OUT THE ROAD.”

Mind you I’m on my ebike riding completely undistracted. Not even music or Google Maps. Just biking along abiding by all the rules of the law. And other than this fucknut, the roads are completely clear. 

I’m just like “I’m allowed to ride here! Read a fucking driver’s manual.” The light turns green and he drives off OVER a sharrow and I honk at him and say “HAVE A GOOD DAYYYYY” and he immediately turns right. I’m hoping because he saw the sharrows and realized he’s a fucking dumb ass. 

Now I’m calming my nerves over a latte before I go to the zoo. I have been bike commuting for 20 years and generally do not feel unsafe riding on ECB. Literally the only thing that put my life in danger was that entitled ass dick scaring and distracting me with his honking and shitty behavior. If you’re uncomfortable driving around cyclists, switch lanes and go along your way. Honking at them will not solve your problems and is likely to cause an accident. ",121,SanDiegan

1nt4w26,FREE Coaching from a Student Coach,11,1759107775.0,"Hi everyone,

I’m a grad student at the University of San Diego working on my Master’s in Leadership Studies. This semester I’m taking a hands-on course in leadership coaching, and I’m looking for **two volunteer clients** to practice with.

**What’s coaching?**  
Coaching is about creating a supportive space to help people move from where they are now to where they want to be. Coaches don’t give advice, rather they ask thoughtful questions that spark reflection and new ideas. The goal is to help clients gain clarity, discover their own solutions, and take steps toward meaningful goals.

**How is this different from therapy?** 

Therapy tends to focus on the past. Therapists help you process past issues and trauma. Coaching focuses on the future, setting goals, and self improvement. Coaches don’t diagnose or treat. They ask questions and facilitate self-discovery.

**What you’d get out of it:**

* Focus on an area of your life or work you’d like to move forward
* Gain new perspectives and clarity
* Try out coaching for free in a supportive, no-pressure setting 

**Commitment:**

* Four 30-minute Zoom sessions between now and December
* Sessions are recorded for my learning only (shared just with me, my mentor coach, and my two professors) 

**Interested?**  
Send me a message, and we can set up a quick 5–10 min call to go over informed consent and book our first session.

Happy to answer questions here too. Thanks for reading!",2,SanDiegan

The issue is I now need a job, and there has been no lack of trying. I am currently a TIG welder, working with stainless steel, aluminum and occasionally mild steel. I do a lot of fabricating as well, I'd say it's a 50/50 mix. Over the last 3 months, I have put out over 85 applications, and yet almost none are being viewed or even getting back to me. I've tried Indeed, LinkedIn, zip recruiter and even just calling/emailing shops. I even have just been applying to other jobs that I would be qualified for (I was an assistant manager at Jamba for 3-4 years and did a great job leading a team). And yet nothing.

I have also applied to the local 206 for their apprenticeship program. Their test is in October, but yet it's a lengthy process to get in, and I'm not even sure I'll get in. So I need help. If anybody knows of any place actively hiring, I'd be happy to give a hand. I don't mind commuting any distance; and I don't mind any shift. Day, mid or night I'll do anything. And I don't want to be picky, but I'm looking for something that will pay more than $23/hr.

Anybody seen this lady before? She stole my blue e-bike (custom built by a friend) in broad daylight from the front of my house. It was mostly hidden from view from the street by my SUV parked in the driveway, and had only been there for a few hours, so I'm wondering if someone tipped her off and she's not from this neighborhood. My gardeners were the only people at the house that morning who would have seen the bike, and I'm suspicious that they let her know about the bike.",70,SanDiegan

We’ll be heading down in the late afternoon from Orange County and would be curious for recommendations or fun places nearby to grab a drink or a bite beforehand. Also curious what the food situation is like at the venue with food trucks and picnic tables, and if that’s worth it.

We already purchased parking through the ACE Parking app. Really appreciate any advice or input, thanks in advance for any help. ",5,SanDiegan

1nmy4w4,Pickleball at a public parks. Are we in the wrong?,140,1758475977.0,"My friends were given a stern talking-to by a neighbor when we were setting up our pickleball equipment on a public basketball court around 8:30am. She cited the noise ordinance that was posted on the court which read ""NOISE OR MUSIC AUDIBLE MORE THAN 50 FEET PROHIBITED"". We politely informed her that games of sport are allowed on a public court at a public park, and that this ordinance was aimed at amplified sound, I.e. loud music over a speaker. This makes sense considering the noise that would come from a pickup basketball game or even just one person dribbling a basketball on the court would easily be audible over 50 feet (for reference, this is about the WIDTH of a basketball court). One other detail is that this park is literally right next to an elementary school, so it seems like this neighbor has a problem with the type of noise that comes from pickleball (which is understandable, but still). 

I am aware that the city has pickleball lines drawn on several courts throughout the county, but these places are often busy and we wanted to have a free space of our own to play. Is there anything specific that forbids us from going to a public basketball in a residential neighborhood to play pickleball? ",188,SanDiegan

—
This person’s dog ran up to me and bit my leg while I was riding my bike near Rancho Santa Fe. She did not have a leash, did not control the dog as it tried to come after me again, and she left while refusing to give me information. Two small and deep punctures bled, and the whole calf muscle is sore today. 

The bite has been reported to county animal control and the RSF HOA. They can not do anything else without information. At the very least this person needs to confirm their dog is immunized and then she needs to fix my handlebars from when the dog took me down. 

I think the dog’s name is Lucy. 

I posted this in another sub and started to get great advice before moderators deleted it. If she comes forward, apologizes, fixes my bike, and takes Humane Society training seriously, I will avoid a suit. If I have to track her down and get the same response as I did yesterday (screaming at me and not taking responsibility,) I’d love the name of a San Diego dog bite lawyer. 

Thanks to everyone who helped out in the other sub. I screenshotted a lot of good advice before it was “moderated.”",133,SanDiegan

Does anyone know of a reptile boarding service that’s more geared towards long term? Every place seems to charge per night but I’m looking more per month/year.

Am I crazy to try to board him or should I just rehome him? And if that, what’s a good organization to go through for that?

A car had completely stopped in the left lane. I was driving a white Jeep Grand Cherokee and had to slam on my brakes, barely stopped with about a foot to spare. Unfortunately, the car behind me couldn’t stop in time and hit me, which caused my Jeep to tap the stopped car in front.

Thankfully, everyone involved is okay.

The driver of the front car got out briefly, then got back in and tried to drive off! Another truck had to block him in to stop him from leaving the scene!

Huge thanks to the guy stopping him! To at least get the guys information.

CHP took report.

If anyone was in the area and has dashcam footage, especially of the front car stopping or the moments leading up to the crash, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance!",6,SanDiegan
1ni6unf,Hit and Run Help,51,1757993533.0,"I was in a hit and run earlier today. I was relying on my dashcam footage to show the license plate but it did not. Here's the info I have:

* 163 N on-ramp at Genesee
* 4pm
* 09/15/2025
* Utah license plate
* White male early 40s

I chased him over to the Balboa East (exit 21) before losing sight of him. Initially, he got out of his car but we were blocking the on ramp so I told him very angrily to get back in his car and pull off to the side somewhere. He refused and didn't like my attitude so he decided to protest by driving off which is a felony, by the way. I had been in an accident a couple months prior and someone vandalized my car shortly after that, so as you know, I'm pissed. Even more so now that he's a hit and run case.

**Vehicle Info**

* Volvo xc70
* Mounting racks
* Tan
* Utah License Plate
* Probably 2007 to early 2010s

The off-ramp was closed and coned off.  I figured I would get off at Clairemont Mesa Blvd instead.  Coudn't do that, it was closed as well.  Kept going north.  The 52 east ramp was also closed. Kept going. Ah, the 52 west ramp appeared to be open, great!  Went west and was planning on get off at Convoy at the landfill exit and double back.  Nope, it was closed as well.    
  
Kept going west on 52 and a lit sign on the right said ""805 SB Connector closed"".  Turned out it wasn't, maybe they hadn't got to it yet, so I was able to get on 805 south.  Immediately saw a sign that said Balboa exit was closed, so I was able to get off on Clairemont Mesa Blvd and head east.

Made it all the way to CMB and the 163 bridge and saw that there was no one around on the exit, although it was coned off like I had seen before (and couldn't exit).

Just hoping that someone would be able to point me to the right direction.

My partner & I's lease in NP has gotten too expensive (<500sqft, $2800) and while I (think) we have the option to stay, I am fully expecting another increase in rent, which we can't afford. I filed for bankruptcy at the end of August, and did not realize at the time how my timing would affect apartment hunting. I had to file due to divorce, a cross country move, and several health problems. I technically make too much to qualify for any housing programs, so I don't have too many options outside cold calling apartments and rentals across the county. 

I have family in the area, but can't move in with them as I have two ESAs (\~20lb dogs) and they all have other dogs. I have a cosigner/guarantor already lined up. We've also considered living in a long term hotel/rental if I can't find an apartment to move into.

1ng58dn,Non-touristy San Diego favorites for family visit (with young kids + 20s sister in law),0,1757788750.0,"I’ve got family visiting soon. They’ve been to San Diego a bunch of times and already done the main tourist things such as the Zoo (Balboa and Safari Park), Balboa Park, PB, La Jolla Cove, Old Town, Coronado, etc. This time we’re looking for new, cool, and off-the-beaten-path things to do.

We’ll have two young kids with us and my sister-in-law who’s in her 20s. So we’re hoping for ideas that are family-friendly but are also maybe more interesting for someone younger who wants to experience the local vibe.

Any hidden gems, quirky neighborhoods, scenic walks, unique food spots, cultural spots, or day trips you’d recommend? Basically anything that feels very San Diego but not just standard tourist stuff.

Thanks in advance for any tips or ideas. Trying to give them a trip that feels fresh even though they’ve been here plenty of times already!",28,SanDiegan

Almost everywhere I've gone adds so much sugar to everything (even the kimchi 🤢) it's disturbing. Or the food is bland, mild, and still manages to give me indigestion. 

Would love to hear from people who have lived in Korea and/or are Korean (Half or full, FOB even better ♥️). Not saying that I don't want opinions from other people but if you love kbbq from the place that used to be in the same building as Zion market or Jeong Won BBQ, I dont think I can trust your recs.

Thanks!

""Director of Communications Rachel Laing provided us with the following statement: “Metered parking is supposed to be a demand-management tactic above all. It’s in commercial areas in order to ensure customers can park, do business and move on. It’s not supposed to be for employees or residents to park all day long. 


Business groups like the Gaslamp Quarter Association, which is supposed to represent the businesses in the Gaslamp, should be embracing tactics that make it easier for those who aren’t attending big special events to find parking downtown to patronize Gaslamp businesses instead of advocating for bartenders to use that incredibly limited resource all night."" 

So, don't put meters in residential areas- densely urban or otherwise, if that's not what you expect us to do. Or tell us, where exactly we should park instead? (NO, NOT EVERYONE CAN GIVE UP THEIR FREAKIN' CAR, so don't even start.)

And where *should* the employees of said businesses park all night without giving up 1/2 their shifts' pay AND GET HOME SAFELY afterwards, which could mean anywhere from 11pm-3am? The trolley- or public transportation in general- isn't even an option for many of those late night employees. ",68,SanDiegan

I felt very uncomfortable with this situation as well this all started off when he told me he has a granddaughter with the same name as mine then the topic he spoke about was changed constantly and even confessed he’s been in a few accidents while driving with passengers and without them and that didn’t even help since he told me that while we were on the freeway also he kept looking back at me while driving to talk😔 and when I tried correcting him to where to drop me off he changed topic and continued.

1nc3py9,Restaurant surcharges at the airport,56,1757375158.0,"I found this little nugget in a U-T article today:

>Food and drink purchases will also include a 2% surcharge, all of which goes directly to the workers. The levy is a hangover from the pandemic years when there were labor shortages in the hospitality industry and employers were having to pay higher hourly wages to find workers. Airport Authority board members agreed to keep it in place for the new Terminal 1 in order to ensure that experienced workers from Terminal 2 would relocate for the startup of the new concessions, said \[Kevin\] Westlye, who lobbied for the surcharge.

[https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/08/food-in-san-diego-airports-new-terminal-is-local-local-local-although-there-is-one-mcdonalds/?share=die0rhemeo2deniadccn](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/08/food-in-san-diego-airports-new-terminal-is-local-local-local-although-there-is-one-mcdonalds/?share=die0rhemeo2deniadccn)

First of all, kudos to the U-T for talking about surcharges! They need to do this every time they talk about a restaurant that has them.

But shame on the Airport Authority. Rather that just achieving the same goal by setting the menu prices 2% higher, the Airport Authority decides it's just fine to hide it in a surcharge. I guess I will be packing my own food next time I go to the airport!",37,SanDiegan
1nc3jqo,Liberty Station/ USS Recruit DUI and Crash 9/6,292,1757374705.0,"This incident occurred at around 4:40p on Saturday 9/6, between the USS Recruit (2558 Laning Rd, San Diego, CA 92106) and the Homewood Suites. **I told all of the following to the police on site, as well at the detectives and all the video and photos I have was submitted on site as evidence for the case.**  

Starting off I know there was an earlier post about this, but wanted to add my own perspective and photos as I was also there with my 5 year old son and need to write all this out. Now there are new spots and articles out I know, but just want to get all this out there too. 

I first noticed the blue BWM which arrived at the same time as me at about 4:10p, as they were in the parking lot (about 100 ft away from the site of the crash) because she was driving slow then abruptly stopping several times before finally pulling sloppily into a handicapped spot nearest to the water. While in the spot (and in park) you could hear the engine revving sporadically, which was odd but seemed like a car issue more than an impaired driver at the time, but I still took mental note of it. 

Then after playing with my son around the ship and same area as the crash, at about 4:35 I head a screech the sound of a small crash, like a car hitting something and then hitting the breaks suddenly. I then remembered the blue car and thought I bet it's the same car, so I went with my son over by the Boil Daddy Restaurant farther away, but rather cautiously as I was not sure what was up with the driver. I walked by the stuck car **(PIC 1)** recording a video at with my phone down, so I could get the plate and situation documented. The car then remained there for a minute or so, not moving and no sounds coming from the car. 

I then called the police at 4:37p to report the strange behavior (earlier and now) and told them the car description and area. As I was doing that she then got unstuck and drove away slowly, 10mph max heading towards the end of the parking lot where she stopped suddenly again and sat there for maybe 30 seconds before hopping the curb at the back end of the USS Recruit and slowly continuing down the large pedestrian area towards the eventual crash site. I was on the line updating the dispatcher and saying that I see them heading towards people and they better already send a unit. 

Then she tried to curve around the area and hit a bolted down bench where she seemed stuck. I was about 100 ft behind at this point as I was following the car on foot while on the line. Then out of nowhere you hear the car accelerate 100% get unstuck from the bench, hit another bench, drive through 2 bushes before swerving and ending up crashing into the tree. From my angle (behind the path) I could not see that anyone was hit until I saw a male carry the girls body away from the car to some soft ground. I let dispatch know that a child was hit and I would try to see if other victims and the status of the girl. She was there with her mom and little brother (3?) who was also on a scooter but only the girl was injured. My guess is the mom reacted and grabbed the little one, then the car hit both scooter and the 5 yo girl. This was about 4:40p, and I will not be describing any of her injuries besides what is already known from news and other posts (head trauma).

The whole area had about 20 people around (soon many more) 2 men were helping the girl, I handed my phone to one of them so he could describe her injuries to dispatch. Meanwhile the driver seemed pissed off and lost, had no idea she hit a kid and did not go over to check on her at all, she just stood by her car door (some people were nearby in case she made a run for it) she was cussing at bystanders and also made a couple phone calls before police arrived. 

The first responder arrived at approximately 4:44 (a SDPD officer who had come from the Midway Area) went straight to the girl to offer first aide, may people pointing out the driver but rightly so he want to the victim. The paramedics arrived shortly after at 4:47. And then a flood of SDPD and SD Harbor Police steadily for the next 10 minutes. 

The girl was assessed, secured and in the ambulance by 4:53p **(Pic 2)**. And that is the most important part of all this. I stayed for about 2 hours after the crash along with 3 other witnesses to tell our stories to the sergeant, and detectives. During this time they marked off the crime scene and taped off large portions of the area, you can see the two destroyed scooters and a girls show in (**PIC 4**). They also searched the car and found a half empty bottle of Liquor (**Makers mark? Pic 3),** they also kept her in a squad for 1.5 hours before doing the filed sobriety tests (**PIC 5**) and eventually ending up in handcuffs again (**PIC 6**).

Not as a pat on my own back because the girl is still fighting for her life, but as a lesson to us all and to myself. IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING. If you notice strange behavior or driving do not hesitate to call the non-emergency police line (call is still recorded and can be instantly upgraded to emergency with the same dispatch system), you never know what could happen next, and in this case something absolutely bizarre, terrible and criminal occurred.

Thinking ahead for the winter because they want us to re-sign our lease soon.

Essentially, we're dealing with a housing rental where while we do have a mini-split in the living room, the bedrooms themselves get very cold at the night. 

The property manager, came by, measured the temperature in our rooms and agreed it was under 70 degrees. Then he said the owner of the house doesn't want to put in a mini-split (in the bedrooms) and we have to just rely on space heaters. 

The problem is that space heaters trip the circuit breaker and they're expensive and dangerous to be running all night.

1n9p525,"Reddit friends,  I have a tough  situation and need some advice work and employee related-",0,1757128922.0,"Posting this  in r/SanDiegan because I am a local, and maybe after reading this, there is someone out there to offer this person some work? Also you all tend to be an understanding, well thought out group of individuals. What field they work in I will answer in PM only- to protect identity.

Without divulging  too many details- Interviewing for an open position at my company North County San Diego - we have  a few very strong candidates- one of them, we vibed with  far better than with than the others. However this candidate is currently tied for being   the most qualified that has interviewed. Great person, extremely  smart, personable, skilled, the whole nine yards.  There are some valid reasons why they are not the most qualified for the position though, so some decisions and further  evaluation is needed.

The BIG issue

When I was explaining that it is a 3 step process and that we are not hiring on the first or second interview- candidate disclosed they are sleeping in their vehicle and would want/ need an advance in the way of a working interview. Also some mentions of a criminal history came out , not too many details and it may not be a big deal, as well as issues at their last job. Anyhow-  because I feel for the fellow human and always try to help , at times to a fault, I have been taken advantage of before- badly- I am wondering what to do . The level of personal details really was off putting, especially because I felt like it was a bit forced on me. this person does belong to a traditionally marginalized group of  people, so my protector instinct was out in full force, especially when hearing a few details of a brave existence that I am very familiar with .

What also is getting to my soul a bit is that the position was advertised as in person work.  During the phone screening, candidate asked if they could work  out of office, if acceptable because they  freelance. I explained that we want people here in person, to see the reaction. Then as the interview progressed- it went to -"" I want all of my computer stuff here, because I do not do computers in my off time, and its in the van , I can set it up now, and start tomorrow. "" Other situations came out - they are on disability , totally broke and I can pay them as an employee partially and then also pay  certain hours as R &D, with a lot of discussion about our tax savings, payroll  and incentives. That also bothered me, as thats not something I want to ever talk about. Their own developing business was also brought up, and how we could just invest in that. NGL, its an AI model that is very important and looks promising. But I do not want our company info used to just feed an AI machine either.

It bothers me that they are in this situation. I do not want a hiring decision to be colored by me feeling bad and wanting someone to go forth in life. I  also want to help.

If I didn't hire the candidate, and the strong candidate did not work out- I would like to go back to this person and offer, if they were still looking. But I need a person who works on just our  tasks, and leaves the big picture out. We pay very well, but we are also a smaller office with a very large field presence. i cannot worry about anyone here   and whether they are on task.

I do think there is a security issue here at the office with the amount of systems knowledge the candidate has, and I would have to hack/tamperproof certain sensitive computers here with a professional in order to let this person work here and still let me sleep at night. I knew it right away- gut feeling. that would require me hiring an IT professional and taking a few weeks to lock things down.

I may be missing out on the next step to really growing my company,  but something is just nagging at me.

Should I ignore the personal details and red flags and just offer a remote , 1 off freelance job to see how they do ? Even though that is not technically what I am advertising?

Advice, thoughts? I am actually still at work 3 hours later than usual. and really upset by this because I have never faced this situation.

TL/DR- please do - I am truly in need of advice

I grew up Southern Baptist/Independent Fundamentalist Baptist and even went to Bible college for a year after high school. I grew up sheltered and as I entered the real world, I began to seriously question faith and religion and realized the faith of my youth just didn’t make sense. 

Now that I’m 36, I find myself intellectually curious about other faiths. I’m not looking for a new belief system, but I am looking to experience worship services for faiths/religions I was raised to believe were wrong. 

So, where do you worship? Are they open to visitors? I know Christian based faiths are, and I have visited a synagogue once, but do you attend a mosque and are they open to someone who wants to experience what one of their religious services looks like? Same with more orthodox sects of Judaism. But even with the Christian based faiths, let me know. I’d like to start going to one service a month just for my own edification. For houses of worship that observe certain modesty rules, I’m happy to abide by those rules. If you’re not comfortable posting that info publicly, feel free to DM. 

This is an earnest request. I’m not looking to go into anywhere and argue, or cause problems. I simply want to observe and have some new experiences. Please let me know if your mosque/church/shul/etc is cool with an open minded woman coming and checking things out. ",22,SanDiegan

If you've never been to the Botanic Garden, it's a lovely stroll - make plenty of time as it's quite large, and there's tons of stuff specifically for kids (near to the entrance). If you're a member of any AHS garden - like the Japanese Friendship Garden - you get free reciprocal admission.

It’s not an isolated incident either — around 500 horses die every year in U.S. racing and training.

I’ve lived here since July 2023- a year in North Park, and a year now in Hillcrest. 

I’m moving, again. I don’t usually move around this much. The first move was to save some money, and this move is due to a crazy neighbor getting in my space and yelling at me about the fact that I accidentally missed a piece of dog poop. 

Anyway…

I am looking at two homes, one in the Castle neighborhood of City Heights and one in the south Swan Canyon neighborhood in City Heights. 

The Castle one is around 41st and Thorn. Street parking. 

The Swan Canyon one is around Fairmount and Maple. I haven’t been to this one yet. Designated parking. 

Am I nuts to be looking in these areas? The homes themselves are great. But every time I tell someone I’m looking in City Heights they grimace in response. 

I don’t tend to go out at night, am a bit of a homebody, and use cameras, locks, etc.

The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority will purchase the existing Wally Park parking facility at the southwest intersection of Kettner Boulevard and Sassafras Street and continue to use the parking structure for airport parking. The parking garage was constructed in 2005 and is comprised of 3 levels with 770 parking stalls, and a 21,780 square foot surface lot with 64 parking stalls. The Airport Authority will utilize the parking facility for airport users, including passengers and employees. Airport users will be shuttled to and from San Diego International Airport using a fleet of airport-operated buses using existing access points to public streets. Consistency with Airport Master Plan. The property is located off of Airport property under the planning jurisdiction of the SDCRAA and outside of the Airport Master Planning jurisdiction. However, parking in the proximity of the airport will be used to serve airport users, including passengers and employees.

1n2iank,Report: Life sciences firm Dexcom to lay off almost 200 San Diego workers,256,1756401463.0,"One set of corporate cutbacks appear to have led to another, with San Diego jobs on the chopping block.

According to a Tuesday report by the San Diego Union-Tribune, Dexcom, which specializes in technology for glucose biosensing, will lay off 350 workers, with nearly 200 of them in San Diego.

The bulk of the local jobs being lost are focused on Dexcom operations and manufacturing, the Union-Tribune reported.

It’s another set of layoffs for the company, located in Sorrento Valley, which let more than 500 workers go last year, according to various media reports.

Dexcom, in its a Forbes profile, states that it employs more than 10,000 people. The firm was founded in 1999. Among the products sold by Dexcom are the G7 and Stelo systems and sensors, which offer varying levels of glucose monitoring.

The Dexcom development follows cutbacks to Verily, a life sciences company that is a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s corporate parent.

According to Business Insider, Verily on Monday announced the shuttering of its devices program, which is perhaps where Dexcom comes in.


Verily’s work included a project with Dexcom on wearable glucose sensors. CEO Stephen Gillett, in a memo obtained by the publication, said there will be “workforce reductions across Verily.”

A representative for Verily confirmed to Business Insider that “we have made the difficult decision to discontinue manufacturing medical devices and will no longer be supporting them going forward.”",36,SanDiegan

1nt85vn,I did a second Neapolitan Pizza Crawl,78,1759117823.0,"The sequel to this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSanDiego/s/1HbSXLS0DN](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSanDiego/s/1HbSXLS0DN)

I went to three more spots, all of which were recommended in my last post! I've known about Isola for a while but never heard of the other two before. They were:

1. Isola Pizza Bar (Little Italy): got the DOP margherita with buffalo mozzarella, pretty good overall but two of the slices were too charred and it was a little wet in the center of the pizza. Also this may be more of a personal preference but the buffalo mozzarella wasn't my favorite and was too chewy. 7.8/10
2. Sonny's Pizza (University Heights): got their margherita which I really enjoyed, the cheese was excellent and the crust was cooked really well with not too much char. My only gripes were that I was expecting the crust to be a bit more pillowy for a Neapolitan-style pizza and I would have liked more sauce on the pizza which made it a little dry. I was thinking the whole time that their NY-style pizza would go better with their style of crust so I definitely plan on going back to try that out! Overall, great rec and it was like a better version of Ellie's in OB. 8.5/10
3. Blade 1936 (Oceanside): got their margherita as well - really great pizza, they had a damn good crust (possibly some of the best I’ve had on a Neapolitan pizza) and really flavorful basil. Their cheese wasn’t my favorite and I wish they added more sauce, but I did see on their menu that you could order more sauce on the side after I finished the pizza haha so I’ll probably do that if I go back. I was also pleasantly surprised they had half off pizzas for happy hour so I only got that pizza for $10! Such a steal and again, great recommendation. 8.7/10

I also went for dessert after Blade to 1022 Gelato which I only heard about recently and they were great as well, their pistachio gelato was incredibly good and might have been my favorite pistachio flavored one in the US; their milk chocolate and stracciatella ones weren’t on the same level IMO but they were both still good and worth getting (I prefer a more dark chocolate gelato so if they had that, I probably would have liked it even more!). I’d give the pistachio one a 9/10 and the other two an 8/10.

Once again, I had a lot of fun doing this and appreciate the recs from my last post!

This is a nice little place tucked in behind Smashburger and Tajima Ramen at the intersection of College and El Cajon Blvd. There are about 6-8 tables. It wasn't very busy and we were given menus and water promptly. I was craving spicy, the partner sweet.

I'll admit it we're not as adventurous as we could be sometimes so be both ordered galbi, the difference being his had bones and I had the spicy boneless. The boneless pieces were cooked to crispy perfection and were a substantial portion at $13.99. The bone in were also enjoyed by my date and were 8 for $14.99. Each came with a side of pickled radish which was a bit of a refresher because the spicy galbi was FREAKIN' HOT (only 2 out of 3 flames on their menu). My eyes were watering. I had to get up and get some extra napkins and I offered some to another patron who was also dabbing her eyes from the spice! All in all a good choice for what I would call fast casual Korean food and I'd definitely go back to try something different.

1nrbqjn,The story of Lucky Wong and his legendary one-man diner in San Diego (KPBS Podcast) — thank you to r/FoodSanDiego for your help!,107,1758917685.0,"Hi everyone, 

My name is Anthony and I am the producer of KPBS's new(ish) arts and culture podcast called The Finest. This episode about the legendary Golden Phenix diner in North Park and its longtime proprietor Lucky is one of our favorites that we've done so far, and we relied on your help at this subreddit to pull it off.

One of the things that initially drew us to this story were the incredible anecdotes that we read in this sub when the diner closed and when Lucky passed away shortly after. We reached out to many of you here to share your stories and we featured your voices on the podcast. 

Lucky was an extraordinary guy who did an ordinary job 6 days a week for nearly 50 years. He was a one-man show—taking orders, cooking food, and serving his diners all by himself well into his 80s. He never had a menu item over $10 because he really loved and cared about his customers. He developed special, unique relationships with thousands of them over the decades, and more than 100 of them attended his funeral. The podcast is full of stories and memories about Lucky—there were so many people who wanted to share with us, a few of which we connected with through this subreddit. 

So I just wanted to say thank you all for your help! And I hope you'll enjoy the podcast we put together about Lucky and his diner. ",2,FoodSanDiego

In the early 2000s, I used to hit up a taco shop in a small lot on the corner of Garnet and Dawes in PB. Today it seems like its 664 TJ Birrieria. Went there at nights or after class for this burrito: steak chicken mushroom melt burrito. 

If I remember clearly, it was basically sliced chicken meat (definitely not shredded chicken), mushrooms, and sour cream (and maybe onions) all cooked on a griddle, then slathered into a burrito. Not sure if there was steak/beef/carne asada or not or if there were other main ingredients. While it sounds like a runny mess, it held it's shape fairly fine similar to a chile verde burrito or a bean & cheese burrito at a typical hole in the wall. I don't recall if the shop had good hot sauce.

However this was a bummer experience because of the terrible service. My friend is African-American and the server was very short with him when he asked questions about the menu, and after that they did not visit our table again for the rest of the visit. Each table received complimentary bread automatically and we asked why we were skipped, and we were told it’s our fault because we didn’t specifically ask for it. At the end we had to stand up and find someone to pay for our meal. After reading a few other reviews online, this seems to be a common experience with some African-American customers and that really sat poorly with me after I slept on it.

It was my first time in California and wow, I can't wait to go back.

Bagel and Lox - Cloud 9 Deli (across from our hotel). wow this place is amazing. huge menu, fresh, fast, amazing service. ended up eating there every day for breakfast. Steven that works there in the AM is awesome.

Carne asada fries and California burrito at Taco Stand - La Jolla. I have decent Mexican food around me in my home state but nothing like this. I have had several sad attempts at California burritos in my day, but nothing as incredible as this behemoth. Fries were awesome too - loved the salsa bar.

Calamari, fish and shrimp tacos at Mitch's seafood. Had lunch here one day. It was really good. tacos were huge and I didnt know that lol, oops. Had some crabcakes too, that were great. The calamari taco was fun, and delicious. Fish taco was absolutely huge, and the shrimp were tender and massive.

Filet mignon breakfast sandwich from Cloud 9 Deli again, god damn this place. Loved the garlic aioli on it, and the crispy hashbrown was a nice touch.

Peruvian bay scallops from Water Grill. These were immaculate, just beautiful. I am also from the midwest and our seafood is fuckin Red Lobster, so I am easy to please when it comes to seafood but wow, this place is amazing. the scallops have pistachio and a citrus pesto. My only regret was getting a half dozen instead of a full dozen.

Halibut Cheeks - Water Grill - these are served pan roasted with braised fennel, brown butter lemon sauce. These were great, but halibut always is.

Wild Ross Chilean Sea Bass. wow, absolutely loved this dish. It is served with caulifolower puree, candided lemon, hazelnuts and brown butter. Easily the best fish dish I have ever had, but again, Long John Silvers is easy to beat.

7 Cheese Mac - Water Grill - dynamite. great side, more than enough for two to share.

Tacos al Pastor and Al Pastor Quesatacos from Chuchys

Fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and octopus tacos from Waves Taco Club. Also bonus pistachio churros with raspberry sauce. These tacos were incredible - I liked them quite a bit more than the ones at Mitch's Seafood and that is saying quite a bit. Highly recommend both places though. I was surprised to see nobody at Waves so not sure if it was just a slow time of day, or if its a new place?

amazing food - amazing people - amazing scenery - wow, san diego is incredible, and we can't wait to come back!",64,FoodSanDiego

Long Version: I get together with a few friends from Clairemont and Poway area about once a month to eat and talk. We found one restaurant where you order at the counter and then seat yourself on a large patio. Because there are no servers, it doesn't feel wrong to stay at the table and talk for a long time. We tip the employees at the counter up front and there is always plenty of space around us for customers coming and going.

Pancakes- crepe style, fresh and delicious, served with a fruit compote that was fantastic.

Chicken kabob- well seasoned, nicely cooked, came with a chutney for dipping

Fermented Roti, whole wheat flatbread for the chicken, soft and tender

Mango Lassi- always a treat, standard lassi.

Slaw salad? Came with the chicken kabob I think, really good.

The best part about all of this? Everything was $18.53. The pancakes were 9 dollars so I got the chicken kabob, roti, lassi, and slaw salad for like 9 bucks. Unbelievable value.

1nbzj0o,Kinme,73,1757364746.0,"I had a couple of family members fly in to visit me and as they particularly like Japanese food it seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally try Kinme. Making a last second reservation wasn’t particularly difficult. Overall I was very satisfied with the experience and the food really was outstanding. Some of my thoughts:

- It was $215 per person for the menu. None of us opted for the pairing but we all did drink a combination of wine and beer. After dinner, drinks, tax and gratuity the total cost ended up being $1,023. That comes to $341 per person for everything and I don’t think it is particularly steep given the 2.5 hour experience and quality of the food. 

- They have a pretty fun drink menu with some interesting Japanese beers and solid wines. What I really enjoyed though was the blue chamomile tea. 

- Service is perfect and prompt. They really have it nailed down. Service is a lot more formal and the chefs more reserved (but still super nice) than what you would expect in some of the other San Diego Omakase spots. 

- Brings me to my next point which is this is much more of a kaiseki experience than a typical omakase, IMHO. And the dinner is a lot more structured and it shows in the complexity in some of the dishes. 

- For me the 3 highlights were the sashimi course, the A5 Miyazaki tartar puff, and the miso black cod. The crab mixed with the soy bean soy paste was one of the best bites I’ve had in a while. And the tartar puff was just so darn delicious. 

- If I were to nitpick at anything it would be the toro tower nigiri and the A5 Miyazaki strip loin dish. Both tasted really good. But the toro tower nigiri was a bit difficult to eat. I noticed for a couple of us it did break apart as we tried to put it in our mouth. It was really freaking good though. And with the strip loin dish I really enjoyed it but having it come towards the end after eating so much was a bit difficult. I finished it because it was really good but I was already feeling full and the fattiness of it didn’t help. 

I don’t think it is entirely correct to compare it with some of the other omakase places. Of course sushi was involved here but it wasn’t the focal point of the dinner. But if I did have to compare them I would say this experience is pretty much at the top. I would at least put alongside Ichifuji as my favorite Japanese meals in town. Certainly a lot better than Soichi or Tadokoro. ",6,FoodSanDiego

Sometimes though, it's nice to veer a little healthier and get your fish grilled. Today we tried Surfside Fish House on Scripps Poway Parkway (not sure if it's technically Scripps Ranch or Poway). Their Happy Hour menu has quite a few gems, including $2 fish tacos. Imagine my surprise when the server asked if I wanted fried or grilled. The tacos were on the smaller side, but still had plenty of fish. We also got their ginger/garlic chicken wings, which were great ($6 for five wings) and some fish ceviche, which was also good. 

They do Happy Hour daily from 3-6pm. There were a lot of people there, which means a couple things to me: First, the seven days a week HH is not done out of desperation to lure people in. Second, there's likely a high turnover of food, which is important with fish, especially raw fish like ceviche or poke.

Okay. We visit San Diego once a year. Two years ago my husband and I went to a Mexican restaurant but it was more of a hole in the wall. What we can remember is that it was small. Dark interior. Like bar/cook top. But also possibly another kitchen or something behind this bar/cook top.  We don’t remember a name of the restaurant on the door but it felt very much like you were going through a back door.  I feel like we were in an area that across the street may have been a pizza place. Or other restaurants.  I know this is a stretch but we loved it. The owners/people behind the counter made us tacos and even made us special tacos.  We felt like we were the only ones in the place.  Where was this place?  I’ve tried to find it again with no luck.

Edit: I've been told my prices are incorrect. Either way Happy Hour pricing was a better deal than dinner menu.

Me and the hubs stumbled upon this place while searching for restaurants in Kearny Mesa for our weekly date night. It's quietly hidden behind a still developing apartment complex. The menu is Lebanese influenced. It is not bar food, we just happened to arrive in time for happy hour.

Happy hour prices reflected below. We had: wings, hummus, margherita pizza, and the boujie burger. **The wings were the best I've ever had**, a really sophisticated complex flavor. 7 wings for what I thought was $9! What? Wait? What? These were legit wings too. The hummus was also one of, if not the best hummus' (hummi?) I've ever had. There was a smoky creamy richness that went well with the olives and pickles. The pita was really good -thick, moist and cooked to perfection, I think it was $6? Another deal! The pizza was also really good $12. We were so full, we took the burger (not a happy hour option) to go along with the fries. We had a few fries while they were hot and to no surprise at this point, they were also cooked to perfection.  Total bill was $67 before tip.

**Now let's talk about this space and service:**

1. The space is industrial/warm and the bar area has two screens with sports on, the restaurant is deep enough that the tv's didn't distract from the dining experience. There's lots of windows with good tinting and window shades. The tables, comfy chairs, and spacing are perfect. They could probably double the number of tables, but keeping a good distance allowed for a more personal experience. I imagine with the high ceilings that too many tables would make this place noisy. The giant cork wall helps to dampen the neglibe echo. There is a huge outdoor space as well as two private rooms. The bathrooms are next level (bidets, fr fr). The whole place has a modern industrial ambiance, but classy. It had a bit of those Alexandria office space vibes.

2.The service was also just right. We were seated quickly and our server, Jesus, took time to explain a bit about the menu. He made sure that our food was staggered and that we were able to pace our meal without feeling rushed. The staff was busy and stayed on top of things. We weren't drinking and the staff made sure we had plenty of water.

**Would I go there again? You betcha. They also donate 3% to local non profits!**",19,FoodSanDiego

Order my usual, Beef Gyro over Rice platter with extra white sauce because I love it when Halal Guys squirt their white sauce all over my meat platter. 

They had a prize wheel today for their grand opening and I won a doughnut. It was kind of a weird prize but better than landing on “sorry” and not get a prize at all. Other prizes include free soda or $5 mini plates. The doughnut was definitely different. 

In comparison to the OG Halal Guys in Manhattan, across from the Midtown Hilton… it’s not as good because the food here was served from a hot steam tray so you don’t really get the char pieces from sitting on the grill a bit too long… but on the flip side you are allowed to customize your plate more with a Chipotle style assembly line. 

If you never been, definitely ask for extra sauce White Sauce packets in addition to what they put on the plate or wrap. Also ask for the hot / red sauce packet. The red / hot sauce can be really spicy if you’re not use to it so if you never had Halal Guys before, I would just ask for the packet and not on the actual food. As for the white sauce, you can never get too much of the white sauce.

- Wayfarer Bread

- Olive Baking Company

- IZOLA

- Parisien Gourmandises

- Marigold Bagels

- Brick & Bell (mostly for the vibes, affordability, and the honey bran muffin!)

- Oscars Mexican Seafood

- The Taco Stand

- Boker Kitchen

- Olympic Greek Cafe

- Amardeen Lebanese Cuisine

- Namino Persian Cuisine

Didn’t love: Relic Bageri, The French Gourmet, Tacos El Gordo (I can’t eat most things on the menu), Flavors of East Africa

On my list: Taco Surf PB, Mike’s Taco Club, La Perla No. 2, Kiko’s Place, Alexi’s Greek Cafe, Awash Ethiopian, Muzita Abyssinian Bistro, Blue Nile, Nomad Donuts, Swirled Buns (popup!)

Not interested in going to Aladdin after the salmonella fiasco. Also, El Cajon is quite far from me and I’m car-less — prefer to look closer to the coast, no further inland than SDSU :) would love to find a Moroccan place!

The tacos from Llamas are unlike the greasy street tacos you often get in San Diego (think Tacos El Gordo). These tacos taste more home made and healthier. The tortilla is bigger and made in house so it’s fluffy. The meat there is all quality. I normally don’t get carne asada or chicken because they tend to come out dry but that’s not the case here. The tacos are $5 each which might be on the pricier side but I think they more than make up for it with their flavor and size. 

I have been there 3 times already but every time I go I’m one of the only people there. I really do not want them to go out of business because I genuinely think their food is great and the staff are friendly as well. Please go out there and support them if you can! ",85,FoodSanDiego

Long story short I’m trying to recreate a memory with my dad. We used to go to Asian Noodles in National City, where they had siomai soup (possibly with egg noodles?). It is now Porky’s, if anyone is familiar with that.

The thing is the siomai was probably 3-4” in diameter, probably 3 pcs per bowl. It was relatively inexpensive but something we used to do together.

Is there a place yall know that serve the big/jumbo siomai in soups? Not Diamond or Emerald.

Thank you!

Edit: seems extremely controversial, so while I'm not willing to argue my point of view on this post, I will state it so I hopefully get less flack. I absolutely tip, almost always 20%. Never ever stiff someone their tip. I understand that servers don't make a lot and that the business basically relies on tips in many places. That being said, in California where I live restaurants must pay minimum wage, which started me thinking: why do we tip if they make minimum? Isn't tipping a thing bc restaurants were allowed to pay less than minimum, so servers relied on tips to get up there? If almost every other country in the world doesn't tip, why do we need to? We should be able to look at a menu item and know we will pay that price for that item. I believe all prices should be built into the listed price, including tax.

1mdieh2,Best Italian with good steak near airport?,9,1753909313.0,"Looking for something near Coronado or the airport. Girlfriend is super picky about steak and unfortunately we don’t have enough time to dedicate to an upscale steakhouse but I’d still like to get her a meal she’ll enjoy. 

Where are our best bets for great pasta and a decent steak?

Edit to add: People are getting oddly offended from this post, so just to clarify: This is a really quick trip to SD for us. We’re going on vacation to Vegas next month for a family reunion (mine), and I’ve booked us a flight to SD on my girlfriend’s birthday as a surprise because she loves the beach. We love a good steakhouse but for us the main enjoyment is spending a couple of hours really exploring the menu (multiple courses, wine pairings, etc ) and taking our time. I’d hate to take her to an amazing steakhouse and then have to say we have to hurry. 

My girlfriend knows we’re a little short on time on her birthday and asked for Italian instead. For us, Italian tends to take less time because we rarely order more than an app to share and an entree. She really wouldn’t care if I just took her to Olive Garden but I would like to do better than that. I’d also really love to be able to surprise her with a restaurant that has a good steak. Not a huge deal if I can’t find this combo, we’ll be doing the big steakhouse dinner when we get back home, and we both love Italian food, I’d just like to make her actual birthday evening as amazing as possible.

We’ll be spending the day on Coronado island and have multiple activities already lined up, so I’m looking for restaurants near there or on the way to the airport just so we have as much time as possible at the restaurant, but a little outside of that range isn’t a big deal either.",35,FoodSanDiego

Warm, soft, tasty. 

The fish was tiny. For $12 my two tacos had enough fish for just one. The fish itself was flaky but the batter was soggy. And the slaw topping completely overpowered the taco. I wanted a fish taco, not coleslaw tacos.

The fish dip was no big deal. Kinda plain with a hint of spice. But no “smoked fish” detected.

I usually cook Indian food since that’s what I grew up with, but I’m always experimenting with fusion~mixing Indian flavors with whatever else sounds good that week. Some days I’m vegetarian or vegan, other days I’ll cook non-veg depending on the mood.

Honestly, meal prepping solo can get repetitive. So if you’re someone who also wants to batch cook for a few days a week, I’m down to team up~your kitchen, my kitchen, either works. Even if you’re just up for swapping recipes or trying out some of the stuff I’m making, that’d be cool. (Also open to borrowing ideas because some of the online meal preps I’ve tried take way longer than promised.)

We can even share groceries for common stuff~it makes things easier and cheaper. I don’t have a car right now, and Uber/Lyft gets expensive fast, so if you’re driving, I’m happy to pitch in for gas. If not, we can still split expenses and do a weekly grocery run together~Wednesdays usually work best for me.

1m0xtqu,Las Cuatro Milpas headed to mandated sale due to unpaid taxes in March 2026,113,1752623713.0,"The popular Barrio Logan eatery could avoid a government tax sale next March if the family owners choose to sell the property before then

Omar Mercado (left) orders his lunch at Las Cuatro Milpas on Logan Avenue. The longtime Barrio Logan eatery faces tens of thousands of dollars in tax debt.

Las Cuatro Milpas, a dining staple in Barrio Logan for nearly a century, is facing a government-mandated sale next March after the owners failed to meet a deadline last month for gradually paying off more than $60,000 in back property taxes.

The ongoing debt, which dates to the 2019-20 tax year, has not kept the popular Mexican restaurant from continuing to operate, but with a five-year repayment plan no longer an option, the fate of the Logan Avenue eatery remains more uncertain.

The only way now to avoid a government sale would be to pay off the entire tax bill by next March or to simply sell the property privately before then. In addition to the property tax bill, there is more than $130,000 in other tax liens on the Las Cuatro Milpas business. The bulk of that sum — a little more than $103,000 — represents unpaid sales taxes owed to the state of California for the past several years, according to lien information provided by the San Diego County assessor's office. Most of the balance of tax debts relates to unpaid federal income tax.

Margarita Hernandez, whose grandparents Petra and Natividad Estudillo opened Las Cuatro Milpas in 1933, is well aware of the tax debt the restaurant is facing but declined to answer questions this week on whether there are any plans in the near future to sell the eatery and an adjoining building that the family has long owned.

Last year, Hernandez, who is in her late 70s, said the family wasn't ready then to sell their land and their business. She said that she personally wanted the restaurant to remain open as long as she and her siblings are healthy and able to continue working.

Up until June 30, the ownership had the option of initiating a five-year payment plan that would have required an initial payment amount to 20% of the owed taxes.",46,FoodSanDiego

I’m hoping for somewhere fun, vibey, and upscale-ish with good food and drinks. We’re staying near pacific beach but don’t mind traveling 20 minutes out for some good eats.

Here’s what we’ve gone through so far:

•	Born & Raised – can’t accommodate our group size unfortunately 

•	Cowboy Star – fully booked Saturday, waiting to hear back about Friday

•	The Lion’s Share – reached out, no response yet

•	Animae – went on a previous trip, loved it but want something new and similar to this

•	Kettner Exchange – not sure if I would love the menu for us, any insight? 


We’re open to any type of food but specifically steak or other meat options for one night and seafood or upscale Mexican for another night. Our ideal budget would be around more or less $100 per person.

1m07e43,The quest for the mystery buttercream from a now closed bakery,47,1752550541.0,"I know this is a stretch, but I need help here, I'm desperate.

There was a bakery in El Cajon called Flour Power Cakery that had a white buttercream which was
SO unique tasting and came to be an obsession of mine during the many years of buying their cakes. The problem is they've been closed for over a year now and I cannot for the life of me find out how they made/where they bought their frosting.

I made an effort to find out right when they first announced they were closing through the company Cute Cakes Bakery who they directed new orders to, but the person who helped us just didn't know. They made some recommendations which I tried buying but neither had the taste of Flour Power. It’s been the white whale of my family and I desperately want that icing on my birthday cakes once more. 

Does anyone know what brand of buttercream they bought or the recipe they used? Do you know anyone who used to work there that might know? I feel like I’m going crazy with all the recipes I’ve tried/brands I’ve purchased trying to get them to taste like Flour Power, any help would be GREATLY appreciated.

1lzf14u,New Pacific Beach Smash Burgers: For the Win vs Smash and Stack,79,1752473977.0,"Couldn’t decide which new smash burger places to try in Pacific Beach… so I got both.  

For The Win:
(The one served in a burger box)
The smashed cheeseburger was served on a potato bun and comes with American cheese, grilled onions, pickle, and their fry sauce. I added bacon and lettuce. The burger itself was $9 plus $1.75 for the bacon and $0.50 for the lettuce. Total for my burger was $11.25 plus tax. 

Smash and Stack:
(The one served in a paper basket)
The smashed cheese burger was served on a brioche bun and comes with cheddar cheese, grilled onions, their “out of this world” sauce, lettuce, and tomatoes. The burger was $11 plus tax. 


For The Win’s burger had a more flavorful beef patty and the cheesy was gooey in a good way and as you would expect how American cheese would melt. The grilled onions are sliced and seems like it was pressed into the meat during grilling.  

Smash and Stack’s burger was flavorful too but the bun was huge and kind of overpowered the single meat patty. The cheddar does set it apart from For the Win with a more sharper cheese flavor. Also the crispy part of the cheddar enhances the burger a bit. 

For the sides, they both offer fries. For the Win serve up more traditional fries while Smash and Stack offers waffle fries. Smash and Stack also offer onion rings and jalapeño poppers while For The Win offers Brussels Sprouts as a side option. They also both offer their variation of the cheese and special sauce fries. 

As far as service and ambiance goes, Smash and Stack is the winner here. For a counter service restaurants, the staff are super upbeat and friendly. They’re also very attentive and check on all the customers to make sure they’re enjoying the food. Also the whole UFO / Space theme gives the restaurant some character and feels laid back and extremely welcoming. 

Whereas For The Win was kind of figure it out yourself type situation. When I went there was a short line so I went up to the person at the end and asked if that was the line to order and he said yes. So I waited for a few minutes and notice people in front of him leaving and eventually he left too. That’s when I saw there was a touch screen at waist level. I asked people that didn’t leave yet if they ordered and they said yes. So I just went up to the kiosk to place my order. There was no one manning the counter as everyone working was either cooking or stocking the fridge. It’s a literal hole in the wall with very limited seating. Only 2 tables and a small counter space.

1ly58qi,Mabel's Gone Fishing - Overhyped?,45,1752339350.0,"In preparation for a San Diego trip, I was browsing around this subreddit for some ""don't miss spots"" and ""favorite restaurants"" and Mabels seemed to come up often in comments (or maybe caught my eye more?). I had never heard of them outside my research on Reddit, but looking at some recommended restaurants lists outside of Reddit, Mabel popped up again.

  
I decided to pull the trigger and I have to say, for all the hype I saw, I was pretty disappointed. The rice and shrimp dish ($30) was standout for sure, excellent flavors, the crunchy rice at the bottom was great. The octopus ($32) was not memorable; texture was good, but flavor was pretty unremarkable. Sea bass dish ($40) again was not really that special. The fish was cooked well (good texture), but honestly, the veggie sides that went with it tasted better than the fish. Their Spanish Gin and Tonic ($16) had an unbalanced taste to it (that said, I'm not a G&T expert. I love craft cocktails and enjoy a regular G&T, but I have not tried many craft G&Ts). The Basque cheesecake ($16) was just fine. Party size 2. 

  
If I set aside the pricing completely, I would expect a restaurant on all these lists AND recommended by many commentors in this subreddit to have every dish taste above average. At best, I will say each dish is average (with the exception of the shrimp and rice dish being outstanding). I give the restaurant credit though, that cooking octopus and fish to perfect doneness isn't easy, but doing that alone without matching flavor doesn't do it for me.

  
If you consider pricing and the portion sizes along with the food quality, this restaurant for me doesn't make the cut for any list of restaurants I would recommend others to in San Diego. I just checked and it seems that Mabel has a Bib Gourmand as well...which is surprising given my experience there. I would say Campfire and Animae are probably good alternatives. 

  
Caveats: Maybe I came during a bad day, maybe my taste buds aren't as refined as others, maybe my standards are too high for price and quality in today's environment where restaurants seem to be serving lower quality foods at higher prices. ",82,FoodSanDiego

I’m an introverted homebody and I’ve got a bit of social anxiety going on but it isn’t too bad. The idea of joining a meetup makes me nervous, I tend to do better with one on one or maybe smaller groups. 

I’m pretty easy to talk to and i’ve always been told i’m really friendly but for some reason i’ve never been able to maintain friendships. Actually, I know the reasons lol. I’ve got awful ADHD and am prone to depression and people usually don’t want to deal with that, which is fair. 

But i’ve been feeling so disconnected lately, even more than usual and I find myself yearning for human connection. The type of loneliness i’ve been living with over the years feels impossible to reverse. But it’s pain and I want better for myself. 

I’m not gonna lie, I don’t have any hobbies atm and I feel absolutely lost and directionless. I don’t have any mentors or influences and what those things provide I cannot provide for myself, i’ve learned. 

I don’t know where i’m going with this lol. I left my apartment to try to go to a concert in LA on impulse but then I realized I wouldn’t even get there in time due to traffic so now i’m just sitting in my car staring out into traffic not knowing where to go or what to do with myself. It’s almost 5pm and I have nowhere to be, no one that’s waiting for me.

🕒 Sessions:

11:45 PM – 3:00PM

3:00 PM – 6:15 PM

6:15 PM – 9:30 PM

📍 Location: Script Lab, 4542 Ruffner St Unit 150, San Diego

💰 Entry Fee: $15 per person

🌟 What is a Script Game?

A Script Game is an immersive, face-to-face tabletop experience.

Think of it as stepping into a story — you’re not watching, you’re becoming the characters. Each player receives a secret role, interacts with others, uncovers clues, and co-creates the narrative.

✨ It’s like Clue meets immersive theater.

No experience needed — it’s beginner-friendly and guided by a professional Game Master.

🎮 Event Details

Each session hosts 12 players total, split across two scripts:

🗡️ **The Dragon Slayer (5 players**)

Rescue the princess. Face the dragons. Become the king—if you dare.

🕯️ **Usher’s Nightmare Tale (7 players)**

Monsters wear masks. So does everyone else.

👉 The final choice of which script to play will be made on-site with the group.

🎲 Duration: \~3 hours 15 minutes per session

🎭 Perfect for mystery lovers, storytellers, and anyone looking for a fun, social night!

🌙 Bonus Event at 9:45 PM

Wrap up the festival with a special Blood On The Clocktower session — a classic social deduction thriller loved worldwide!

⚠️ Important: Please arrive on time for your selected session. Due to the nature of Script Games, we cannot start if players are late. No refunds for no-shows or late arrivals.

[**https://www.meetup.com/san-diego-local-mmo-meetup-guild**](https://www.meetup.com/san-diego-local-mmo-meetup-guild)

Hey all, I'm Tom, 40 years old, looking for more players (25+ years old preferred). This Meetup guild started in late March as a single static group & has grown to 20ish active players for different games and 50 in the discord quickly. We have a friends & family feel with players all over SD in North, South, East, & Central county. The group is a local connection hub for us to hang and meet in person when we can every few weeks & have an MMO many of us play be the glue.

We just finished playing Pantheon for a few months as the pace progression MMO and now are starting [**Project Ascenscion** ](https://ascension.gg/en)(Area 52 realm). Many are planning to play Monsters & Memories when beta opens early next year. There's also some people playing Everquest Online Adventures & a Final Fantasy XI group is starting up. We've had people play Dune Awakening, Everquest: The Hero's Journey, Everquest Project 1999,. A couple people have checked out Ashes of Creation Alpha 2. There is also an organized online board game Sunderfolk group going.

The pace progression game nights are done day of signing up by listing your character(s) you want to play and we hash out the groups before the sessions. This is a social game night for people that want to play 4-8 sessions a month. Some people may play other characters more and have a dedicated alt for the pace progression nights. Girls don't be shy, we have two female group members already and they'd love more female company!

Here is our planned schedule (people still play outside these hours as well):

**Schedule drop-in playtime:**  
Mondays 6:30-8:30pm  
Fridays 7-9pm

**Meetup:**  
Every other Sunday 5-7pm rotating through local bars with bar games, arcade bars, or gastropubs in central SD (Brewski's in Mira Mesa, Coin Haus in La Mesa etc.) We are always looking to add new fun venues in the rotation that are an easy enough drive for everyone.

The pace progression MMO in the group will always be an affordable and accessible one so the pool can easily grow. There is heavy interest in games like Monsters & Memories and at least 4 people have bought the Alpha 2 & Beta 1+2 keys for Ashes of Creation. These are very likely to become pace progression MMOs in the future for the guild when they are easily accessible & affordable. It'd be nice to keep growing a pool that could sustain two MMOs at the same time.

We people that have played Panth, EQ, DAoC, WoW, FFXI, & Vanguard vets. I live in North Park and moved here last June and I've been familiar with it for a long time visiting friends here for years, and it is now home to me.

The idea for the group is something relaxed and casual, and something to look forward to as a nice easy way to be social & have camraderie. I'd like to have people that have some roots down in San Diego so there is more room for some long friendships to form over time.",0,SanDiegoSocial
1mqid99,Interested in walking with a naturalist?,35,1755217785.0,"I don't have anything in particular in mind, but I'd like to gauge interest in exploring a canyon or other open space with someone who could identify plants and animals. I'm an environmental biologist who knows more about ecology, habitats, and regulations more than connecting with other humans, so I'm just putting this out there to see what happens. We could walk around Mirimar Reservoir, visit Los Penasquitos Canyon, or just meet at a local park and see what we find. 

-----

Edit: Thank you everyone for your interest! I will be at the San Clemente Canyon Trail (Marian Bear Open Space Park) off Regents Rd. at 8:00 am on Saturday, August 23. Parking is available in the dirt lot at the trailhead. Look for a tall man with long brown hair wearing a tan long-sleeve shirt at the trailhead. 

This will be an out and back hike from the parking lot, passing under Genesee Ave, and turning back at some point past that, up to 4 miles round trip or so depending on how far we wish to go. The trail is relatively flat, there is some shade, and we will be pausing to look at plants and any wildlife we encounter, so this will be suitable for beginning hikers. Feel free to catch up to us if you arrive later or head out early if you don't want to go the whole way. 

Please wear boots or closed-toes shoes you don't mind getting dirty, sun protection (e.g., sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, long-sleeve shirt, pants), and bring water (and binoculars if you have them). See you there!

Edit 2: It's going to be hot, so we'll be back to the parking lot no later than 10:00 am out of an abundance of caution. Water and sun protection are a must!",26,SanDiegoSocial

I’m a 25-year-old female who recently moved to San Diego, and I’m looking to make some genuine connections — whether that’s finding a solid group of girls or even just one good friend to vibe with.

I’m not into the clubbing or drinking scene, but I do enjoy smoking hookah and love checking out new restaurants, hitting the beach, going on hikes, and just exploring all the fun things this city has to offer. If you’re into chill vibes, good food, and meaningful friendship, let’s connect!

1mcjkdm,Hey San Diegans!,18,1753814129.0,"Hey, Y'all!

I hope your week and Tuesday are off to a good start, It's been so nice out lately! The weather has been perfect and ideal for summer, I hope it lasts!

I gotta be honest, I've been kinda down in the dumps lately, I don't know why. Maybe it's just a general malaise setting in, a continuous feeling of routine and predictability.

Luckily, I find that the best way to get rid of a slump is to help someone else get out of theirs!

So I would like to offer a helping hand to anyone who feels like they are in a rut, or stuck in on place for whatever reason! Maybe there is a looming task you need to get done but don't know how or where to get started?

We could all use a helping hand from time to time but don't know who to ask or turn to, or maybe because nobody has offered to help? 

Whatever your reason may be I am not here to judge, just help. So whether you need something heavy lifted or moved, maybe your garage needs a bit of cleaning, or your garden could use some weeding, a tree needs pruning? Maybe you just need someone to vent to? I can help!

San Diego has given a lot to me, so it's only fair that I give back from time to time, in whatever way I can.

It's Tuesday! That means taco deals all over SD! So I plan to work hard today and spend my night getting some late night tacos at my favorite place La Fachada!

I consider myself lucky that I get to work outside on days like these. It's sunny, it's warm and there is a steady breeze rolling through. It's so ideal. So make some time for yourself to get outside and experience everything you pay the sunshine tax for!

And if being outside isn't your jam, I get it, I'm an indoor cat myself for the most part. I recently got into video games! I'm terrible at them but they are a lot of fun. I'd like to recommend you check out Blasphemous! It's a Castlevania style game and it's pretty damn cool. Hard as hell though!

Anyway, Here's wishing you all a great Tuesday and an excellent rest of your week!

Stay Up!",0,SanDiegoSocial

The boat itself looked super fun, open-air, BYOB, music playing, just a relaxed little ride around the bay while spotting wildlife. It’s run by this company called Tiki Time Bay Tours. Never heard of them before but the whole setup looked like a cool mix of sightseeing and just hanging out on the water (and let’s be real, any excuse to be on a boat is a good one).

***Sept. 1-7***  
***Nov. 1-10***

Hey all, I'm Tom, 40 years old, looking for more players (25+ years old preferred). This Meetup guild started in late March as a single static group & has grown to 15 active players and 50 in the discord quickly. We have a friends & family feel with players all over SD in North, South, East, & Central county. We just met our first invited member in-game very recently that asked what the SD in SD Locals was for and he and his girlfriend joined the guild :) The guild is to serve as a local connection hub for us to hang and meet in person when we can every few weeks & have an MMO we all play be the glue.

We are currently playing [Pantheon](https://www.pantheonmmo.com/) as the main MMO, and we are starting to look at playing a different main game. If/when we do want to switch we will have a vote for a new main game focus. We also have some people playing Dune Awakening, Everquest: The Hero's Journey, & Everquest Project 1999. A couple other players are playing WoW Ascension & Warhammer Return of Reckoning, & Ashes of Creation Alpha 2. There is also an organized online board game Sunderfolk group going.

The guild pool play days for the main focus game are done day of signing up by listing your characters you wanna play and I hash out the groups before the sessions. This is for casual players that want to play 6-8 sessions a month along with people that play more have a dedicated lower level alt to play with the pool at the same pacing.

Here is our planned schedule (people still play outside these hours as well):

**Schedule drop-in playtime:**  
Mondays 6:30-8:30pm  
Fridays 7-9pm

**Meetup:**  
Every other Sunday 5-7pm rotating through local bars with bar games, arcade bars, or gastropubs in central SD (Common Theory in Kearny Mesa, Coin Haus in La Mesa etc.) We are always looking to add new fun venues in the rotation that are an easy enough drive for everyone.

The main MMO in the group will always be an affordable and accessible one so the pool can easily grow. There is heavy interest in games like Monsters & Memories and at least 4 people have bought the Alpha 2 & Beta 1+2 keys for Ashes of Creation. These are very likely to become main MMOs in the future for the guild when they are easily accessible & affordable. It'd be nice to keep growing a pool that could sustain two MMOs at the same time.

Anyone that wants a preview of the Pantheon if they haven't played can join the discord, say hi, and then you can come hang during at one of our weekly set play sessions for a bit while one of us screencasts to see how you like it. Even if you don't want to play the game you're welcome to hang in the discord and come to the meetups. I'm sure people will also play some games on the side together and we have a text channel for people to link up for that, we also have people that like boardgames. Girls don't be shy, we have two female group members already and they'd love more female company!

We people that have played Panth and new players, EQ, DAoC, WoW, FFXI, & Vanguard vets. I live in North Park and moved here last June and I've been familiar with it for a long time visiting friends here for years, and it is now home to me.

The idea for the group is something relaxed and casual, and something to look forward to as a nice easy way to be social & have camraderie. I'd like to have people that have some roots down in San Diego so there is more room for some long friendships to form over time.",0,SanDiegoSocial

TBH I’m kinda nervous (I know on the FAQ they say it’s good for introverts but I’m still nervous, what can I say lol). The whole thing is basically you talk to strangers about meaningful stuff, without having to talk about small talk. The whole thing is structured and it’s all based in psychology research, and it’s mainly for people in their 20’s and 30’s, FYI.

1klphjb,"""Free"" Dungeons and Dragons 101 Class. Saturday, May 31st 2pm-6pm in Miramar @ AtEase Games. Come Learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons and support our local underfunded classrooms!",14,1747151615.0,"Hello everyone!

I am excited to announce that I will be running another Dungeons and Dragons 101 class at At Ease Games in Miramar this month!

I designed this class to teach you how to get started understanding and playing the game with the absolute basics, in a relaxed, no-stakes environment.

If you've been wanting to learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons but don't know where or how to get started, this class breaks everything down into small pieces to better help you get started.

The class is open to all ages and experience levels so don't let knowing nothing stop you from attending.

Here's a rundown of the class.

2pm-4pm: We get into the absolute basics, getting started with creating your character and understanding the more simple mechanics of the game, like what character creation is, what do all these numbers mean? Roll Initiative? Skill Checks? What's that? Everything gets answered in this segment.

-BREAK-

4pm-6pm: The second half of the class goes into more detail regarding combat mechanics, spell casting, action economy, and world-building.

6pm-7pm I'll be running a short game for anyone still in attendance who want to experience playing the game first hand using the characters you create!

THINGS YOU'LL NEED:
- something to take notes with (pencil is recommended) 
- something to take notes on.

I will have handouts for everyone but if you have a Players Handbook already I recommend you bring it.

THAT'S IT!

Bring your friends, family, neighbors, ANYONE and learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons for a good cause.

ADMISSION PRICE: We are collecting Journals this month in order to promote creative writing in our classrooms. We appreciate any and all donations of 
- Journals
- Pencils, Pens, Markers, and Highlighters
- Stickers
- Erasers
Realistically, we appreciate any and all donations.

If you are not able to make it to the class but would still like to donate to the cause Please feel free to message me and I will provide a way to receive your donation.

Also, please be sure to support the venue, At Ease has been kind enough to host me and my classes for years now and I encourage everyone to sample their wares.

Lastly, If you plan on attending just leave a comment saying ""Going"" so I can get a head count for the day of.

Well, that's all folks! 

Mark your calendars and set yourself a reminder because you won't want to miss this class!

See you there!",0,SanDiegoSocial

1kl9yiq,On the hunt for friends!,26,1747100262.0,"Hey all,

I’m a 37 year old single dad and I haven’t spent time cultivating my community/personal relationships for quite some time. My kids are getting a little older (10/13) so I figured it’s time to step out of my box. I’ve been here for 11 years now, so not fresh and new to SD.

I know a lot of people say to go do hobbies you enjoy and you’ll meet friends, but truth be told I haven’t had those either for a while. And trying to browse through Meetup now feels like I’m just scrolling through literal sales pitches for real estate and marketing. 

I do like hanging out at the pool, going to the beach, hitting up breweries, and going to hockey games, but I’m really open to trying just about anything. 

If anyone is interested in expanding their friend group, shoot me a message! I’m free to hang out most weekends (fri-sun) and Wednesday afternoons. I live in Chula but work in RB so distance isn’t really a problem for me!

Looking forward to hearing from you!",11,SanDiegoSocial
1khzo90,"San Diego: Brand new MMORPG Meetup guild starting L1's on Pantheon fresh start server this Friday! (11 active players, 28 in discord & growing!)",7,1746734459.0,"Here's our discord link (SD Locals MMO Meetup) please come check it out & say hi!  
[**https://discord.gg/AWGAF4gHEm**](https://discord.gg/AWGAF4gHEm)

Hey all, I'm Tom, 40 years old, looking for more players (25+ years old preferred). This guild started in late March as a single static group & has grown to 13 active players and 32 in the discord quickly. We have a friends & family feel with players all over SD in North, South, East, & Central county. We just met our first invited member in-game very recently that asked what the SD in SD Locals was for and he and his girlfriend joined the guild :)

We are currently playing [Pantheon](https://www.pantheonmmo.com/) as the main MMO and are open to changing MMOs down the road. We are about to begin on the fresh start server Veil of Azeris this Friday as level 1's. The guild is to serve as a local connection hub for us to hang and meet in person when we can every few weeks & have an MMO we all play be the glue.

The pool play days are done day of signing up by listing your characters you wanna play and I hash out the groups before the sessions. Our goal would be to have a big enough pool, maybe 15-20 active players & 10+ show up per play day so we can mix & match 2 groups easily if not more down the road.

Some people play more, others are more casual & mostly come to the drop-ins. We have a #lfg and #group-planning channel to get people linked up. We already have a handful of people that play often :)

We are starting to form a culture around Friday being the main play day where the people that play more frequently end up having a Friday character(s) that stay at the level of people who only play Fridays. They either play that lower level alt character or they help powerlevel & protect the group(s) with their higher level character. Sometimes we have 2 groups that hit the same dense camp next to each other with everyone in the same voice channel.

Main drop-in play day:  
Friday 7-9pm

Second drop-in play day:  
Monday 6:30-8:30pm

Meetup:  
Every other Sunday 5-7pm rotating through local arcade bars or gastropubs in central SD (Coin Haus, Gaslamp Coin-Op).   
  
We are currently playing [Pantheon](https://www.pantheonmmo.com/) as the main MMO and are open to changing MMOs down the road. The main MMO in the group will always be an affordable and accessible one so the pool can easily grow. There is heavy interest in games like Monsters & Memories and at least 4 people have bought the Alpha 2 & Beta 1+2 keys for Ashes of Creation. These are very likely to become main MMOs in the future for the guild when they are easily accessible & affordable. It'd be nice to keep growing a pool that could sustain a few MMOs at a time.

Anyone that wants a preview of the Pantheon if they haven't played can join the discord, say hi, and then you can come hang during at one of our weekly set play sessions for a bit while one of us screencasts to see how you like it. Even if you don't want to play the game you're welcome to hang in the discord and come to the meetups. I'm sure people will also play some games on the side together and we have a text channel for people to link up for that, we also have people that like boardgames. Girls don't be shy, we have two female group members already and they'd love more female company!

We people that have played Panth and new players, EQ, DAoC, WoW vets.

I live in North Park and moved here last June and I've been familiar with it for a long time visiting friends here for years, and it is now home to me. It would be great if everyone lived within a 20 minute drive or something easy enough that many of us can meet up at the central SD get together every 2 weeks or so!

The idea for the group is something relaxed and casual, and something to look forward to as a nice easy way to be social & have camraderie. I'd like to have people that have some roots down in San Diego so there is more room for some long friendships to form over time.

The reason we picked Pantheon is because 3 of us have already started playing before and already enjoy it, it's a fresh game, and it is a very social game where all group members have unique and important roles for the group to succeed so there is a lot of teamwork & camraderie! Beyond that there is also lots to talk about - different classes, zones, mobs (enemy NPCs), gear, crafting, new content & game systems etc... Some people describe Pantheon as the modern successor to Everquest 1 & 2 with some combat feelings from World of Warcraft and Vanguard. It is in early access right now, and has a development roadmap and active community. I've been playing since mid December with my cousin and had a lot of fun playing many different classes.

1kf3x2c,"Looking for Tech Enthusiasts in San Diego – Let’s Meet, Talk IT, and Build Real Friendships",10,1746422455.0,"Hey San Diego,

I'm hoping to connect with fellow IT and tech enthusiasts here in San Diego — not just to talk shop, but to build real friendships, swap knowledge, and maybe even collaborate on cool projects together.

I’ve been in the IT space for about 18 years and have played with just about everything:  
🖥️ Custom NAS setups, homelabs, Windows & Linux servers  
🌐 Networking gear, cloud services, virtualization  
🤖 AI, automation, Docker, self-hosted tools  
🎮 Crypto and gaming rigs, and media centers like Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin

Due to some health and personal reasons, I stepped away from work for about a year. Now that I’m getting back on track and seeking new employment opportunities, I’ve realized how little real human networking I’ve done in the IT space. I don’t really have people around me who share these interests — and that’s what brought me here.

At its core, networking isn’t just about wires and systems — it’s about people. It’s human connections. We connect through our passions, our curiosity, and our willingness to learn and support each other. That’s the kind of network I’m looking to build.

Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, if you're someone who enjoys learning and geeking out with others, I’d genuinely love to chat. Maybe we share resources, explore new tools, help each other grow, or even find new job opportunities along the way.

If this sounds like your vibe, drop a comment or shoot me a message. Let’s turn online messages into offline friendships and make the San Diego tech scene a little more connected. 🙌

I'm looking to connect with someone who’s passionate (or curious) about **podcasting** and has **free time to meet in person** **or online** to talk and brainstorm. Whether you're just getting started or already have some experience, the main goal is to **learn, share knowledge, and bounce ideas** together.

Topics I'm interested in discussing:

* What mics and gear to use
* How to create and grow a podcast channel
* Recording & editing software
* Video podcasting & short clips
* Branding, format, and content strategy
* And all other podcast-related stuff!
* You should enjoy good conversation, have a friendly and positive vibe, and feel comfortable connecting with others—this isn’t for someone who’s super socially awkward or closed off.

Ideally, you’re someone who’s passionate about learning, enjoys collaborating, and is open to sharing ideas. For now, I’m just looking to **network, make friends, and connect with others who share a love for podcasting** or want to explore it as a hobby.

If you’re super busy or have a lot going on in life, this probably won’t be the best fit. But if you’re **local to San Diego**, have some **free time**, and have always wanted to learn about podcasting—or just want to test gear, swap ideas, and build new skills—**hit me up**.

We have gotten more interest possibly adding two more people soon, and girls don't be shy, we have two female group members already and they'd love more female company!

We can grow the pool into a guild and possibly the new people can form a second static group with their own set playtime and scheduling.

Happy Hump Day! The weekend is within sight!

I hope your week is off to a good start, all this rain has been so relaxing, hopefully we get more during spring.

It feels like a perfect day to hit up Balboa Park or maybe even a hiking trail (not me though, I will die if I try hiking). Or maybe grab a pint and do saome day drinking and some disk golf!

San Diego has so much to do that it often gets hard to choose what to do. What's your favorite San Diego simple pleasure?

For me, my favorite would have to be crossing the Coronado Bridge, walking to the ferry dock and watch the city skyline at night. Just sitting on the docks admiring our beautiful city.

There's also all the farmers markets across the city Little Italy, Santee, and Ocean Beach! If you can please support our local vendors, farmers, and makers (just make sure they pay taxes in SD).

It feels like it's getting harder and harder to find spaces where you can just be. A quiet space that you don't have to pay to be in, which is why I appreciate just how much nature there is in San Diego.

We have beautiful walkable neighborhoods all with hidden gems to explore, the walkway on 30th street heading into South Park, any of our beaches, trails, libraries, and the various parklets that are starting to pop up all over the city.

Approved by the mods, thank you!

**Hi everyone!**

My name is Maddie, and I’m a lifelong San Diego resident who, honestly, feels pretty lonely.

I’ve noticed all the recent posts about how tough it is to make friends in San Diego. While I know I can’t solve the loneliness problem entirely, I’ve come up with a couple of ways to help.

**1. A Free Friendship Matchmaking Service!**

I’ve set up a completely free way to help people connect. Just fill out this Google Form, and I’ll personally match you with a new friend based on shared interests and preferences! Here’s a link: [https://forms.gle/r7RacuX8DTZiRPFe6](https://forms.gle/r7RacuX8DTZiRPFe6) 

A few important notes:

* I won’t just pair you with the first person I see—I want to make thoughtful matches that actually have a good chance of working. Depending on how many responses I get, it might take some time, but I’m committed to making sure everyone gets at least one match.
* Match emails will come from [**maddie@getflared.com**](mailto:maddie@getflared.com) (check your spam folder just in case!).
* I will **only** use your information for friendship matching—nothing else.

**2. Flared: A Free Friend-Finding App**

I’m also launching Flared, a completely free app designed to help people find friends for specific activities. If you’re looking to connect with others who share your interests, you can check it out at [**https://getflared.com**](https://getflared.com/).

**Why Am I Doing This?**

1j4w22g,Dungeons and Dragons 101 Class! Come learn the absolute basics of D&D while supporting our local underfunded schools! Saturday March 22nd 2pm-6pm @ At Ease Games in Miramar!,21,1741269565.0,"Hello everyone! Just in time for Spring!

I am excited to announce that I will be running another Dungeons and Dragons 101 class at At Ease Games in Miramar this month!

I designed this class to teach you how to get started understanding and playing the game with the absolute basics, in  a relaxed, no-stakes environment.

If you've been wanting to learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons but don't know where or how to get started, this class breaks everything down into small pieces to better help you get started.

The class is open to all ages and experience levels so don't let knowing nothing stop you from attending.  

Here's a rundown of the class.

2pm-4pm: We get into the absolute basics on getting started with creating your character and understanding the more simple mechanics of the game, like what character creation is, what do all these numbers mean? Roll Initiative? Skill Checks? What's that? Everything gets answered in this segment.

-BREAK-

4pm-6pm:  The second half of the class goes into more detail regarding combat mechanics, spell casting, action economy, and world-building.

6pm-7pm I'll be running a short game for anyone still in attendance who want to experience playing the game first hand using the characters you  create!

THINGS YOU'LL NEED: 

- a 7-die set OR dice rolling app 

- something to take notes with (pencil is recommended) 

- I will have handouts for everyone but if you have a 5th edition Players Handbook already I recommend you bring it. 

THAT'S IT!

Bring your friends, family, neighbors,  ANYONE and learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons for a good cause. 

ADMISSION PRICE: 

A donation of new/unopened school supplies that'll be donated to a local underfunded school and/or classroom in the San Diego Unified School District.

Things most often needed included:

-Paper, notebooks, journals, construction paper, fill paper. 

- Pens, pencils, markers, highlighters, crayons, dry erase markers, sharpeners. 

- pencil cases, erasers, rulers, chalk. 

-Backpacks, folders, binders, paper sleeves.

- Learning/developmental games and prizes.

Realistically, we appreciate any and all donations.

If you are not able to make it to the class but would still like to donate to the cause Please feel free to message me and I will provide a way to receive your donation. 

Also, plese be sure to support the venue, At Ease has been kind enough to host me and my classes for years now and I encourage everyone to sample their wares. 

Lastly, If you plan on attending just leave a comment saying ""Going"" so I can get a head count for the day of.

Well, that's all folks! Mark your calendars and set yourself a reminder because you won't want to miss this class!

See you there!",3,SanDiegoSocial

Just looking for people to hang out with: go out to dinner or lunch, see a movie at the theater, attend a concert, go to a baseball game, play pickup basketball, etc. Basically, it would be nice to have people to do activities with.

1ayzzv7,San Diego FC - Santee,5,1708795489.0,"
San Diego FC (the new Major League Soccer team) has been hosting some pretty cool events called “Chrome Ball Tour” the point of the event is to drive awareness of the new team. Each event is slightly different, and the Santee event will have signups for 7v7 boys, 7v7 girls, 11v11 women, 11v11 men. Winners will get cash and prizes. The other big this happening at these events are meeting supporters.

If you are not familiar with soccer culture, supporters play a huge role in building the culture of the team. They host events like: painting parties (before each game we will paint a giant canvas to hang at kickoff), chant / drum practice, tailgates, general meetups / mixers, away game watch parties, away game travel, and a lot more. 

Personally I have met some of the best people I have ever met in my life in supporters groups. There is no barrier to entry, so if you think you might want to meet cool people, drink, chant, wave flags, pop smoke, and learn the game, I would encourage you to come meet the supporters!

\- Bar hopping in North Park (that's where I'll be staying)

\- Skateboarding or surfing (I can't actually do either, but it would be fun to give it a go)

\- Eating my bodyweight in Mexican food (the UK has the worst Mexican food, so I need to stock up while I'm there) 

\- Any tours (I did a wine tour in little Italy last time and it was lush)

\- Seeing any lesser-know attractions

\- Anything else you'd recommend!

zykpcm,Volunteer Opportunities Are Great Ways to Make Friends!,27,1672357949.0,"**One of the most rewarding ways that I have connected with people and built adventurous friend groups has been through volunteering. I wanted to share one of those opportunities here that I think is amazing. I'm sort of blasting it everywhere because I think MAAC is so amazing. It wouldn't let me upload the flyer so I'm just entering the information they send in emails:**

MAAC Project (Metropolitan Area Advisory Committee on Anti-Poverty) is hosting VITA again this Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA). VITA helps qualifying low to moderate income community members receive free basic tax preparation by trained volunteers. The clinic dates for the next tax season will be January 23rd - April 15th in the following locations:

Mondays: Barrio Logan (1-8pm)

Tuesdays: Chula Vista (1-8pm)

Wednesdays: Spring Valley (1-8pm)

Saturdays: Vista (9-5)

Volunteers receive free training to certify in basic and advanced tax law in order to prepare tax returns. Training and filing is pretty easy and doesn't require any post-secondary education or specific skills in finance or math - only that volunteers be 18 or older. Volunteers choose their locations and schedule, have support throughout their time, can receive recommendation letters and opportunities to build their professional network, and up to 18 Continuing Education Credits.

If you are interested sign up here: [https://forms.office.com/r/HcCffZvzXf](https://forms.office.com/r/HcCffZvzXf)

I was made aware that the form link is suspicious, especially for people who don't know VITA is IRS led, and they provide orgs like MAAC with what they need to host VITA filing. This is the MAAC website and you can sign up. The form I shared above is linked at the bottom of their page: [https://maacproject.org/vita/](https://forms.office.com/r/HcCffZvzXf)",7,SanDiegoSocial

It's aiming to another beautiful day here in San Diego and it's Friday on top of it all!

I have been missing out on a lot of what makes San Diego so amazing the last few months due to life and demands so it's nice to surface from time to time.

Summer is in full swing and there is tones to do in our fine city. Balboa Park is looking amazing , the zoo just had a bunch of new plants and flowers installed, the beaches are blowing up with activity. It's been said a million times we are very fortunate to live here.

It's been a while since I've made a post like this. It's been a while since I've been able to reach out and just say hello to you all.

I won't be so long winded in this post, I just wanted to remind y'all how much I love this city and as great as this city is it doesn't mean anything without its people.

We may not live next to each other but that doesn't mean you are not my neighbor and I try to be good to my neighbors whenever I can. Should you find yourself in need of help or need someone to talk to or just someone to listen know that you have someone you can reach out to without judgement.

Times are tough but they are made easier when you have someone willing to help.

Here's wishing everyone an amazing Friday and an incredible weekend .

I’d love to take him on a walk with a trained, calm, preferably large dog so he can get some exposure.  We have been working with him on-leash at dog parks and the behaviorist has had him during a board and train.  Happy to answer any questions about his behavior/progress if you have concerns.

twvfrx,New in town and going to be hosting regular game nights/grill outs/video game tournaments/kid play dates/adventure bike rides/skateboarding/whatever. Interested?,30,1649166718.0,"I was pretty socially active back in Seattle pre-COVID and I'd like to get back to that good place again. I enjoy meeting new people and hearing their story - and telling a few of my own, and I have some good ones. I work hard to make sure everyone is having a good time, doing something interesting, and the vibe is comfortable.

About me: 40/m/straight white dude, but totally down with every color of the rainbow. We love all peoples, all colors, all genders, all ya'll and then some. I am a left-leaning thinker that finds what people have in common to be far more interesting than how they differ. If you are ultra far-left or ultra far-right, please stay far away from my scene and we'll all be much, much better off. I'm an atheist and don't find religion super interesting. I enjoy drinking cocktails and learning how to make them correctly (sadly, I am just starting to learn how). Beer is good, but I practice a form of ""light"" keto. Why light? Because people don't want to talk about diets, so let's just get back to the pitch. Occasional weed use, mostly edibles, and never when in charge of the kids - and I don't want to smell it either, so no smoking anything indoors. Ah, the kids - I have 3 littles, ages 3/5/5. Today was their first day of kindergarten (!) thanks to an RV trip we took a few months back (crossed the US twice). My wife is a little younger than me and is equally in love with live and living. I batted well above my average when I married her. ;)

Our place: We're in San Marcos for a year, renting a house with a small pool and a generous hot tub. We've got a little space for swimming, grilling, chilling in the backyard and a big couch and comfy chairs in a bright, open living room. There are two large tables (6 and 8 person) for gaming, as well as several more places good for social / group games. Oh, and we have about 100 board games, so you can bring a favorite to share or just show up and jump in on one you've never seen. Parking shouldn't be an issue unless we get into the 6+ vehicle situation, and even then we have ample parking nearby. I also have a good movie collection and love old 90's stuff and everything animated (though I'm not into anime). Food is on the healthier side and we eat meat often, however we're very willing to accommodate any reasonable food request.

What we hope you are: Interested in meeting interesting people. You participate in your life, or at least want to do so more. You're kind to others and you try to be kind to yourself. We have kids, and we've been foster parents, so forever, first, and foremost, we're parents. We won't allow bad people into their life, so don't be a bad person. You want to be part of a group of people that shares experiences, makes connections, tells good stories, and goes home at a reasonable hour because we respect that we're all adults with responsibilities. We're not kids, we don't party like they do. But we do make fun of them and roll our eyes, hard. We have 18 and 22 year old sons back in Seattle. We love them and miss them, so you'll endure a story or two. :P

I'd prefer to do a oneshot to make sure we mesh well before committing to a campaign. I prefer PF2e, but I'm open to trying DND 5e if Tal'dorei Reborn content is allowed. (Legend of Vox Machina really made me want to try the Tal'dorei content.)

My playstyle (based on what little experience I have): I like character building and development, I want to get better at roleplaying, I like being crafty with puzzles and problem solving, and I like making people laugh. I'm usually not good at taking the lead in social interactions.

It mainly consists of women in their 20's and 30's, but all women are welcome.  There's usually between 25-40 people. We mostly talk and hang out.  No serious book discussions.

The book we are reading for February is The Sweetness of Water. March's book will be The Midnight Library. Upcoming books: Hidden Valley Road, The Night Watchman, and Razorblade Tears

As you may know I like to help out around the community and lately I've been wanting to do something special for the SD community.

I want to donate 2 hours of my time to anyone who may need an extra set of hands around the house or just in general.

The two hours can be used for helping around the house with general chores and labor (dishes, laundry, general cleaning), pet sitting, garden care, tree pruning etc...etc.

A few things not covered are any specialized work that requires a permit, tool/equipment rental, any parts and materials needed, and haul-away of waste materials as I don't have the equipment for that.

I'm not promoting anything nor selling anything. No bait 'n hook, no hidden charges just straight up 2 hours of another set of hands.

So if you or anyone you know could use some extra help DM me and we can schedule a time slot.

Hello everyone and Happy Holiday season to you. 

I am exited to announce that I will be hosting a DnD class designed to teach you how to play starting with the absolute basics.

If you've been wanting to learn but don't know where to start or become too overwhelmed by the volume of new info this class will break everything down into small pieces to better help you get started.

Just in time for the holidays!

Admission is any donation of new/unopened animal food or supplies that'll be donated to a local animal shelter to help with the holiday pinch.

The class is open to all ages and experience levels so don't let that stop you from coming! 

4pm-6pm: 101 Class goes into absolute basics and getting started with creating your character and understanding the more simple mechanics of the game.

6pm-8pm: 102 Class goes into more detail regarding combat mechanics, spell casting, action economy, alignment and world-building.

8pm-10pm I'll be running a short One-shot game for anyone in attendance who want to experience playing the game first hand! 

THINGS YOU'LL NEED
- a 7-die set or dice rolling app 
- something you write with (pencil is recommended) 
- if you have the core rulebook I recommend you bring it but I'll have hand outs for everyone. 

THAT'S IT!

Bring you friends, family, neighbors,  ANYONE and learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons for a good cause. 

We'll see you all there!

I wanted to let you all know of a project I am starting back up called The Roving DM.

If you've struggled to find a DM for your group then this may be a great way to get a regular game going for you and your crew.

The Roving DM is an ongoing writing project of mine that I have built over the years and used as the main setting for most of my campaigns. I have written as much as I can but need players to interact with the world I've created in order to further develop it.

So if your group has been looking for a DM with no luck then this might be the event for you!

Currently I can commit to 2 monthly sessions in person (outdoors) or online. Meaning I can either run 2 sessions for one group or 1 session for two groups monthly.

If you already have a group but just need a DM drop me a message and we can coordinate schedules and details.

[The last bonfire](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiegosocial/comments/o15kvb/summer_bonfire_location_tbd_mission_bay_park/) was a fun, inclusive group of friendly humans. If you're looking to meet a nice group of kind, empathetic, like-minded people after a hellish year - look no forward than the wonderful community of San Diego redditors. As always reach out with any questions. [Consult the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgEpJO4JQj6hOvbtlK5UFgiog_UjCIkeVV7Hqhl2JRY/edit#gid=1095001731) for items you'd like to sign up for.

No glass containers. For any libations on San Diego public beaches, do so at your own discretion and responsibly as *itistechnicallynotlegal*. I will bring some s'mores, utensils and plates, trash bags, and firewood. Bring firewood, any potlucky sides, chair, drinks, etc.

I hope to see you there! It will be BYOB and BYO chair. I won't be able to coordinate pit sitting that day, but I'm gonna get out there early to dump some stuff and risk it. I'm thinking we'll be at the same pit in Bonita Cove again just to make things easy. Parking sucked but worked, just plan accordingly.  Coordinates to be posted.

Also a quick plug to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/AXjzpnEhZM) chat, as the spontaneous meet ups have been *very* active there and it's definitely worth the time to join and check out the event calendar.

Thanks friends!

I chose Sandwiches and he chose where. I'm glad he did. This place has a lot of different vibes. There's outdoor wooden picnic tables. But once you get inside you're transported into a super clean, fun, bright and full of baked goodness space. They make their bread onsite and the pastries looked amazing. We were there for the sandos. I had the lobster roll about $23.50 and it was full of meat and not too much mayo. It came with house made potato chips. The roll was buttery toasted perfection. My buddy had the shrimp po' boy $20 and thought it was deilicious. You order at the counter and they bring you your food. The server was very friendly and we enjoyed our meal. Definitely would be back. If you go, make sure you go upstairs for a view into their production area.

I went to three more spots, all of which were recommended in my last post! I've known about Isola for a while but never heard of the other two before. They were:

1. Isola Pizza Bar (Little Italy): got the DOP margherita with buffalo mozzarella, pretty good overall but two of the slices were too charred and it was a little wet in the center of the pizza. Also this may be more of a personal preference but the buffalo mozzarella wasn't my favorite and was too chewy. 7.8/10
2. Sonny's Pizza (University Heights): got their margherita which I really enjoyed, the cheese was excellent and the crust was cooked really well with not too much char. My only gripes were that I was expecting the crust to be a bit more pillowy for a Neapolitan-style pizza and I would have liked more sauce on the pizza which made it a little dry. I was thinking the whole time that their NY-style pizza would go better with their style of crust so I definitely plan on going back to try that out! Overall, great rec and it was like a better version of Ellie's in OB. 8.5/10
3. Blade 1936 (Oceanside): got their margherita as well - really great pizza, they had a damn good crust (possibly some of the best I’ve had on a Neapolitan pizza) and really flavorful basil. Their cheese wasn’t my favorite and I wish they added more sauce, but I did see on their menu that you could order more sauce on the side after I finished the pizza haha so I’ll probably do that if I go back. I was also pleasantly surprised they had half off pizzas for happy hour so I only got that pizza for $10! Such a steal and again, great recommendation. 8.7/10

I also went for dessert after Blade to 1022 Gelato which I only heard about recently and they were great as well, their pistachio gelato was incredibly good and might have been my favorite pistachio flavored one in the US; their milk chocolate and stracciatella ones weren’t on the same level IMO but they were both still good and worth getting (I prefer a more dark chocolate gelato so if they had that, I probably would have liked it even more!). I’d give the pistachio one a 9/10 and the other two an 8/10.

Once again, I had a lot of fun doing this and appreciate the recs from my last post!

This is a nice little place tucked in behind Smashburger and Tajima Ramen at the intersection of College and El Cajon Blvd. There are about 6-8 tables. It wasn't very busy and we were given menus and water promptly. I was craving spicy, the partner sweet.

I'll admit it we're not as adventurous as we could be sometimes so be both ordered galbi, the difference being his had bones and I had the spicy boneless. The boneless pieces were cooked to crispy perfection and were a substantial portion at $13.99. The bone in were also enjoyed by my date and were 8 for $14.99. Each came with a side of pickled radish which was a bit of a refresher because the spicy galbi was FREAKIN' HOT (only 2 out of 3 flames on their menu). My eyes were watering. I had to get up and get some extra napkins and I offered some to another patron who was also dabbing her eyes from the spice! All in all a good choice for what I would call fast casual Korean food and I'd definitely go back to try something different.

1nrbqjn,The story of Lucky Wong and his legendary one-man diner in San Diego (KPBS Podcast) — thank you to r/FoodSanDiego for your help!,107,1758917685.0,"Hi everyone, 

My name is Anthony and I am the producer of KPBS's new(ish) arts and culture podcast called The Finest. This episode about the legendary Golden Phenix diner in North Park and its longtime proprietor Lucky is one of our favorites that we've done so far, and we relied on your help at this subreddit to pull it off.

One of the things that initially drew us to this story were the incredible anecdotes that we read in this sub when the diner closed and when Lucky passed away shortly after. We reached out to many of you here to share your stories and we featured your voices on the podcast. 

Lucky was an extraordinary guy who did an ordinary job 6 days a week for nearly 50 years. He was a one-man show—taking orders, cooking food, and serving his diners all by himself well into his 80s. He never had a menu item over $10 because he really loved and cared about his customers. He developed special, unique relationships with thousands of them over the decades, and more than 100 of them attended his funeral. The podcast is full of stories and memories about Lucky—there were so many people who wanted to share with us, a few of which we connected with through this subreddit. 

So I just wanted to say thank you all for your help! And I hope you'll enjoy the podcast we put together about Lucky and his diner. ",2,FoodSanDiego

In the early 2000s, I used to hit up a taco shop in a small lot on the corner of Garnet and Dawes in PB. Today it seems like its 664 TJ Birrieria. Went there at nights or after class for this burrito: steak chicken mushroom melt burrito. 

If I remember clearly, it was basically sliced chicken meat (definitely not shredded chicken), mushrooms, and sour cream (and maybe onions) all cooked on a griddle, then slathered into a burrito. Not sure if there was steak/beef/carne asada or not or if there were other main ingredients. While it sounds like a runny mess, it held it's shape fairly fine similar to a chile verde burrito or a bean & cheese burrito at a typical hole in the wall.

My friend is African-American and the server was very short with him when he asked questions about the menu, and after that they did not visit our table again for the rest of the visit. Each table received complimentary bread automatically and we asked why we were skipped, and we were told it’s our fault because we didn’t specifically ask for it. At the end we had to stand up and find someone to pay for our meal.

We spent 2 days there, and then drove down the coast (Santa Monica, Laguna Beach, San Clemente) until we finally reached San Diego to stay for a few days. It was my first time in California and wow, I can't wait to go back.

Bagel and Lox - Cloud 9 Deli (across from our hotel). wow this place is amazing. huge menu, fresh, fast, amazing service. ended up eating there every day for breakfast. Steven that works there in the AM is awesome.

Carne asada fries and California burrito at Taco Stand - La Jolla. I have decent Mexican food around me in my home state but nothing like this. I have had several sad attempts at California burritos in my day, but nothing as incredible as this behemoth. Fries were awesome too - loved the salsa bar.

Calamari, fish and shrimp tacos at Mitch's seafood. Had lunch here one day. It was really good. tacos were huge and I didnt know that lol, oops. Had some crabcakes too, that were great. The calamari taco was fun, and delicious. Fish taco was absolutely huge, and the shrimp were tender and massive.

Filet mignon breakfast sandwich from Cloud 9 Deli again, god damn this place. Loved the garlic aioli on it, and the crispy hashbrown was a nice touch.

Peruvian bay scallops from Water Grill. These were immaculate, just beautiful. I am also from the midwest and our seafood is fuckin Red Lobster, so I am easy to please when it comes to seafood but wow, this place is amazing. the scallops have pistachio and a citrus pesto. My only regret was getting a half dozen instead of a full dozen.

Halibut Cheeks - Water Grill - these are served pan roasted with braised fennel, brown butter lemon sauce. These were great, but halibut always is.

Wild Ross Chilean Sea Bass. wow, absolutely loved this dish. It is served with caulifolower puree, candided lemon, hazelnuts and brown butter. Easily the best fish dish I have ever had, but again, Long John Silvers is easy to beat.

7 Cheese Mac - Water Grill - dynamite. great side, more than enough for two to share.

Tacos al Pastor and Al Pastor Quesatacos from Chuchys

Fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and octopus tacos from Waves Taco Club. Also bonus pistachio churros with raspberry sauce. These tacos were incredible - I liked them quite a bit more than the ones at Mitch's Seafood and that is saying quite a bit. Highly recommend both places though. I was surprised to see nobody at Waves so not sure if it was just a slow time of day, or if its a new place?

Mango Lassi- always a treat, standard lassi.

Slaw salad? Came with the chicken kabob I think, really good.

The best part about all of this? Everything was $18.53. The pancakes were 9 dollars so I got the chicken kabob, roti, lassi, and slaw salad for like 9 bucks. Unbelievable value.

1nbzj0o,Kinme,74,1757364746.0,"I had a couple of family members fly in to visit me and as they particularly like Japanese food it seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally try Kinme. Making a last second reservation wasn’t particularly difficult. Overall I was very satisfied with the experience and the food really was outstanding. Some of my thoughts:

- It was $215 per person for the menu. None of us opted for the pairing but we all did drink a combination of wine and beer. After dinner, drinks, tax and gratuity the total cost ended up being $1,023. That comes to $341 per person for everything and I don’t think it is particularly steep given the 2.5 hour experience and quality of the food. 

- They have a pretty fun drink menu with some interesting Japanese beers and solid wines. What I really enjoyed though was the blue chamomile tea. 

- Service is perfect and prompt. They really have it nailed down. Service is a lot more formal and the chefs more reserved (but still super nice) than what you would expect in some of the other San Diego Omakase spots. 

- Brings me to my next point which is this is much more of a kaiseki experience than a typical omakase, IMHO. And the dinner is a lot more structured and it shows in the complexity in some of the dishes. 

- For me the 3 highlights were the sashimi course, the A5 Miyazaki tartar puff, and the miso black cod. The crab mixed with the soy bean soy paste was one of the best bites I’ve had in a while. And the tartar puff was just so darn delicious. 

- If I were to nitpick at anything it would be the toro tower nigiri and the A5 Miyazaki strip loin dish. Both tasted really good. But the toro tower nigiri was a bit difficult to eat. I noticed for a couple of us it did break apart as we tried to put it in our mouth. It was really freaking good though. And with the strip loin dish I really enjoyed it but having it come towards the end after eating so much was a bit difficult. I finished it because it was really good but I was already feeling full and the fattiness of it didn’t help. 

I don’t think it is entirely correct to compare it with some of the other omakase places. Of course sushi was involved here but it wasn’t the focal point of the dinner. But if I did have to compare them I would say this experience is pretty much at the top. I would at least put alongside Ichifuji as my favorite Japanese meals in town. Certainly a lot better than Soichi or Tadokoro. ",6,FoodSanDiego

They do Happy Hour daily from 3-6pm. There were a lot of people there, which means a couple things to me: First, the seven days a week HH is not done out of desperation to lure people in.

Edit: I've been told my prices are incorrect. Either way Happy Hour pricing was a better deal than dinner menu.

Me and the hubs stumbled upon this place while searching for restaurants in Kearny Mesa for our weekly date night. It's quietly hidden behind a still developing apartment complex. The menu is Lebanese influenced. It is not bar food, we just happened to arrive in time for happy hour.

Happy hour prices reflected below. We had: wings, hummus, margherita pizza, and the boujie burger. **The wings were the best I've ever had**, a really sophisticated complex flavor. 7 wings for what I thought was $9! What? Wait? What? These were legit wings too. The hummus was also one of, if not the best hummus' (hummi?) I've ever had. There was a smoky creamy richness that went well with the olives and pickles. The pita was really good -thick, moist and cooked to perfection, I think it was $6? Another deal! The pizza was also really good $12. We were so full, we took the burger (not a happy hour option) to go along with the fries. We had a few fries while they were hot and to no surprise at this point, they were also cooked to perfection.  Total bill was $67 before tip.

**Now let's talk about this space and service:**

1. The space is industrial/warm and the bar area has two screens with sports on, the restaurant is deep enough that the tv's didn't distract from the dining experience. There's lots of windows with good tinting and window shades. The tables, comfy chairs, and spacing are perfect. They could probably double the number of tables, but keeping a good distance allowed for a more personal experience. I imagine with the high ceilings that too many tables would make this place noisy. The giant cork wall helps to dampen the neglibe echo. There is a huge outdoor space as well as two private rooms. The bathrooms are next level (bidets, fr fr). The whole place has a modern industrial ambiance, but classy. It had a bit of those Alexandria office space vibes.

2.The service was also just right. We were seated quickly and our server, Jesus, took time to explain a bit about the menu. He made sure that our food was staggered and that we were able to pace our meal without feeling rushed. The staff was busy and stayed on top of things. We weren't drinking and the staff made sure we had plenty of water.

Order my usual, Beef Gyro over Rice platter with extra white sauce because I love it when Halal Guys squirt their white sauce all over my meat platter. 

They had a prize wheel today for their grand opening and I won a doughnut. It was kind of a weird prize but better than landing on “sorry” and not get a prize at all. Other prizes include free soda or $5 mini plates. The doughnut was definitely different. 

In comparison to the OG Halal Guys in Manhattan, across from the Midtown Hilton… it’s not as good because the food here was served from a hot steam tray so you don’t really get the char pieces from sitting on the grill a bit too long… but on the flip side you are allowed to customize your plate more with a Chipotle style assembly line. 

If you never been, definitely ask for extra sauce White Sauce packets in addition to what they put on the plate or wrap. Also ask for the hot / red sauce packet. The red / hot sauce can be really spicy if you’re not use to it so if you never had Halal Guys before, I would just ask for the packet and not on the actual food. As for the white sauce, you can never get too much of the white sauce.

The tacos from Llamas are unlike the greasy street tacos you often get in San Diego (think Tacos El Gordo). These tacos taste more home made and healthier. The tortilla is bigger and made in house so it’s fluffy. The meat there is all quality. I normally don’t get carne asada or chicken because they tend to come out dry but that’s not the case here. The tacos are $5 each which might be on the pricier side but I think they more than make up for it with their flavor and size.

1mfzhxy,Jumbo siomai in soup?,3,1754164087.0,"Hi all,

Long story short I’m trying to recreate a memory with my dad. We used to go to Asian Noodles in National City, where they had siomai soup (possibly with egg noodles?). It is now Porky’s, if anyone is familiar with that.

The thing is the siomai was probably 3-4” in diameter, probably 3 pcs per bowl. It was relatively inexpensive but something we used to do together.

Is there a place yall know that serve the big/jumbo siomai in soups? Not Diamond or Emerald.

Thank you!

ETA: Found out that this place was supposed to be like an international location for a Filipino Chinese restaurant called Ma Mon Luk, which is now only in the Philippines and (maybe) in Illinois. Here is the siomai in question!!!

Edit: seems extremely controversial, so while I'm not willing to argue my point of view on this post, I will state it so I hopefully get less flack. I absolutely tip, almost always 20%. Never ever stiff someone their tip. I understand that servers don't make a lot and that the business basically relies on tips in many places. That being said, in California where I live restaurants must pay minimum wage, which started me thinking: why do we tip if they make minimum? Isn't tipping a thing bc restaurants were allowed to pay less than minimum, so servers relied on tips to get up there? If almost every other country in the world doesn't tip, why do we need to? We should be able to look at a menu item and know we will pay that price for that item. I believe all prices should be built into the listed price, including tax. I understand that's a likely failing business model currently in the US, I get it. I'd like to support anyone trying it nonetheless. I hope that clears anything up.",34,FoodSanDiego

1mdieh2,Best Italian with good steak near airport?,11,1753909313.0,"Looking for something near Coronado or the airport. Girlfriend is super picky about steak and unfortunately we don’t have enough time to dedicate to an upscale steakhouse but I’d still like to get her a meal she’ll enjoy. 

Where are our best bets for great pasta and a decent steak?

Edit to add: People are getting oddly offended from this post, so just to clarify: This is a really quick trip to SD for us. We’re going on vacation to Vegas next month for a family reunion (mine), and I’ve booked us a flight to SD on my girlfriend’s birthday as a surprise because she loves the beach. We love a good steakhouse but for us the main enjoyment is spending a couple of hours really exploring the menu (multiple courses, wine pairings, etc ) and taking our time. I’d hate to take her to an amazing steakhouse and then have to say we have to hurry. 

My girlfriend knows we’re a little short on time on her birthday and asked for Italian instead. For us, Italian tends to take less time because we rarely order more than an app to share and an entree. She really wouldn’t care if I just took her to Olive Garden but I would like to do better than that. I’d also really love to be able to surprise her with a restaurant that has a good steak. Not a huge deal if I can’t find this combo, we’ll be doing the big steakhouse dinner when we get back home, and we both love Italian food, I’d just like to make her actual birthday evening as amazing as possible.

We’ll be spending the day on Coronado island and have multiple activities already lined up, so I’m looking for restaurants near there or on the way to the airport just so we have as much time as possible at the restaurant, but a little outside of that range isn’t a big deal either.",35,FoodSanDiego

Honestly, meal prepping solo can get repetitive. So if you’re someone who also wants to batch cook for a few days a week, I’m down to team up~your kitchen, my kitchen, either works. Even if you’re just up for swapping recipes or trying out some of the stuff I’m making, that’d be cool. (Also open to borrowing ideas because some of the online meal preps I’ve tried take way longer than promised.)

We can even share groceries for common stuff~it makes things easier and cheaper. I don’t have a car right now, and Uber/Lyft gets expensive fast, so if you’re driving, I’m happy to pitch in for gas. If not, we can still split expenses and do a weekly grocery run together~Wednesdays usually work best for me.

I’m new to the Rancho Bernardo / 4S Ranch area, so I’m also looking to make new friends in the process. If this sounds like your vibe, let me know!",2,FoodSanDiego

1m0xtqu,Las Cuatro Milpas headed to mandated sale due to unpaid taxes in March 2026,112,1752623713.0,"The popular Barrio Logan eatery could avoid a government tax sale next March if the family owners choose to sell the property before then

Omar Mercado (left) orders his lunch at Las Cuatro Milpas on Logan Avenue. The longtime Barrio Logan eatery faces tens of thousands of dollars in tax debt.

Las Cuatro Milpas, a dining staple in Barrio Logan for nearly a century, is facing a government-mandated sale next March after the owners failed to meet a deadline last month for gradually paying off more than $60,000 in back property taxes.

The ongoing debt, which dates to the 2019-20 tax year, has not kept the popular Mexican restaurant from continuing to operate, but with a five-year repayment plan no longer an option, the fate of the Logan Avenue eatery remains more uncertain.

The only way now to avoid a government sale would be to pay off the entire tax bill by next March or to simply sell the property privately before then. In addition to the property tax bill, there is more than $130,000 in other tax liens on the Las Cuatro Milpas business. The bulk of that sum — a little more than $103,000 — represents unpaid sales taxes owed to the state of California for the past several years, according to lien information provided by the San Diego County assessor's office. Most of the balance of tax debts relates to unpaid federal income tax.

Margarita Hernandez, whose grandparents Petra and Natividad Estudillo opened Las Cuatro Milpas in 1933, is well aware of the tax debt the restaurant is facing but declined to answer questions this week on whether there are any plans in the near future to sell the eatery and an adjoining building that the family has long owned.

Last year, Hernandez, who is in her late 70s, said the family wasn't ready then to sell their land and their business. She said that she personally wanted the restaurant to remain open as long as she and her siblings are healthy and able to continue working.

Up until June 30, the ownership had the option of initiating a five-year payment plan that would have required an initial payment amount to 20% of the owed taxes.",46,FoodSanDiego

•	Cowboy Star – fully booked Saturday, waiting to hear back about Friday

•	The Lion’s Share – reached out, no response yet

•	Animae – went on a previous trip, loved it but want something new and similar to this

•	Kettner Exchange – not sure if I would love the menu for us, any insight?

1m07e43,The quest for the mystery buttercream from a now closed bakery,48,1752550541.0,"I know this is a stretch, but I need help here, I'm desperate.

There was a bakery in El Cajon called Flour Power Cakery that had a white buttercream which was
SO unique tasting and came to be an obsession of mine during the many years of buying their cakes. The problem is they've been closed for over a year now and I cannot for the life of me find out how they made/where they bought their frosting.

I made an effort to find out right when they first announced they were closing through the company Cute Cakes Bakery who they directed new orders to, but the person who helped us just didn't know. They made some recommendations which I tried buying but neither had the taste of Flour Power. It’s been the white whale of my family and I desperately want that icing on my birthday cakes once more. 

Does anyone know what brand of buttercream they bought or the recipe they used? Do you know anyone who used to work there that might know?

1lzf14u,New Pacific Beach Smash Burgers: For the Win vs Smash and Stack,79,1752473977.0,"Couldn’t decide which new smash burger places to try in Pacific Beach… so I got both.  

For The Win:
(The one served in a burger box)
The smashed cheeseburger was served on a potato bun and comes with American cheese, grilled onions, pickle, and their fry sauce. I added bacon and lettuce. The burger itself was $9 plus $1.75 for the bacon and $0.50 for the lettuce. Total for my burger was $11.25 plus tax. 

Smash and Stack:
(The one served in a paper basket)
The smashed cheese burger was served on a brioche bun and comes with cheddar cheese, grilled onions, their “out of this world” sauce, lettuce, and tomatoes. The burger was $11 plus tax. 


For The Win’s burger had a more flavorful beef patty and the cheesy was gooey in a good way and as you would expect how American cheese would melt. The grilled onions are sliced and seems like it was pressed into the meat during grilling.  

Smash and Stack’s burger was flavorful too but the bun was huge and kind of overpowered the single meat patty. The cheddar does set it apart from For the Win with a more sharper cheese flavor. Also the crispy part of the cheddar enhances the burger a bit. 

For the sides, they both offer fries. For the Win serve up more traditional fries while Smash and Stack offers waffle fries. Smash and Stack also offer onion rings and jalapeño poppers while For The Win offers Brussels Sprouts as a side option. They also both offer their variation of the cheese and special sauce fries. 

As far as service and ambiance goes, Smash and Stack is the winner here. For a counter service restaurants, the staff are super upbeat and friendly. They’re also very attentive and check on all the customers to make sure they’re enjoying the food. Also the whole UFO / Space theme gives the restaurant some character and feels laid back and extremely welcoming. 

Whereas For The Win was kind of figure it out yourself type situation. When I went there was a short line so I went up to the person at the end and asked if that was the line to order and he said yes. So I waited for a few minutes and notice people in front of him leaving and eventually he left too. That’s when I saw there was a touch screen at waist level. I asked people that didn’t leave yet if they ordered and they said yes. So I just went up to the kiosk to place my order. There was no one manning the counter as everyone working was either cooking or stocking the fridge. It’s a literal hole in the wall with very limited seating. Only 2 tables and a small counter space.

1ly58qi,Mabel's Gone Fishing - Overhyped?,45,1752339350.0,"In preparation for a San Diego trip, I was browsing around this subreddit for some ""don't miss spots"" and ""favorite restaurants"" and Mabels seemed to come up often in comments (or maybe caught my eye more?). I had never heard of them outside my research on Reddit, but looking at some recommended restaurants lists outside of Reddit, Mabel popped up again.

  
I decided to pull the trigger and I have to say, for all the hype I saw, I was pretty disappointed. The rice and shrimp dish ($30) was standout for sure, excellent flavors, the crunchy rice at the bottom was great. The octopus ($32) was not memorable; texture was good, but flavor was pretty unremarkable. Sea bass dish ($40) again was not really that special. The fish was cooked well (good texture), but honestly, the veggie sides that went with it tasted better than the fish. Their Spanish Gin and Tonic ($16) had an unbalanced taste to it (that said, I'm not a G&T expert. I love craft cocktails and enjoy a regular G&T, but I have not tried many craft G&Ts). The Basque cheesecake ($16) was just fine. Party size 2. 

  
If I set aside the pricing completely, I would expect a restaurant on all these lists AND recommended by many commentors in this subreddit to have every dish taste above average. At best, I will say each dish is average (with the exception of the shrimp and rice dish being outstanding). I give the restaurant credit though, that cooking octopus and fish to perfect doneness isn't easy, but doing that alone without matching flavor doesn't do it for me.

  
If you consider pricing and the portion sizes along with the food quality, this restaurant for me doesn't make the cut for any list of restaurants I would recommend others to in San Diego. I just checked and it seems that Mabel has a Bib Gourmand as well...which is surprising given my experience there. I would say Campfire and Animae are probably good alternatives. 

  
Caveats: Maybe I came during a bad day, maybe my taste buds aren't as refined as others, maybe my standards are too high for price and quality in today's environment where restaurants seem to be serving lower quality foods at higher prices. ",82,FoodSanDiego

Hello, I will be visiting the San Diego area later this month. I will be staying in Encinitas, but will be taking my youngest to the San Diego Zoo, and do some sight seeing. I am a major foodie, been a part of the Yelp Elite Squad for 14 years, and enjoy trying new foods. I am kind of picky, and prefer good quality foods over cheap ingredients. Last time I visited I tried several sushi places, Din Tai Fung, and Woomiok. Would love some suggestions for the best Korean restaurants maybe in the Kearny Mesa area or UTC area. I am also interested in trying a really good Japanese ramen shop, healthy food options, interesting vegan places, modern American cuisine, Asian fusion restaurants, and just good food in general that are locally owned in the San Diego area. Thank in advance. Oh, and if you all know of a really good coffee shop in Encinitas please spill the beans for me! ",42,FoodSanDiego

I’m an introverted homebody and I’ve got a bit of social anxiety going on but it isn’t too bad. The idea of joining a meetup makes me nervous, I tend to do better with one on one or maybe smaller groups. 

I’m pretty easy to talk to and i’ve always been told i’m really friendly but for some reason i’ve never been able to maintain friendships. Actually, I know the reasons lol. I’ve got awful ADHD and am prone to depression and people usually don’t want to deal with that, which is fair. 

But i’ve been feeling so disconnected lately, even more than usual and I find myself yearning for human connection. The type of loneliness i’ve been living with over the years feels impossible to reverse. But it’s pain and I want better for myself. 

I’m not gonna lie, I don’t have any hobbies atm and I feel absolutely lost and directionless. I don’t have any mentors or influences and what those things provide I cannot provide for myself, i’ve learned. 

I don’t know where i’m going with this lol. I left my apartment to try to go to a concert in LA on impulse but then I realized I wouldn’t even get there in time due to traffic so now i’m just sitting in my car staring out into traffic not knowing where to go or what to do with myself.

🌟 What is a Script Game?

A Script Game is an immersive, face-to-face tabletop experience.

Think of it as stepping into a story — you’re not watching, you’re becoming the characters. Each player receives a secret role, interacts with others, uncovers clues, and co-creates the narrative.

✨ It’s like Clue meets immersive theater.

No experience needed — it’s beginner-friendly and guided by a professional Game Master.

🎮 Event Details

Each session hosts 12 players total, split across two scripts:

🗡️ **The Dragon Slayer (5 players**)

Rescue the princess. Face the dragons. Become the king—if you dare.

🕯️ **Usher’s Nightmare Tale (7 players)**

Monsters wear masks. So does everyone else.

👉 The final choice of which script to play will be made on-site with the group.

🎲 Duration: \~3 hours 15 minutes per session

🎭 Perfect for mystery lovers, storytellers, and anyone looking for a fun, social night!

🌙 Bonus Event at 9:45 PM

Wrap up the festival with a special Blood On The Clocktower session — a classic social deduction thriller loved worldwide!

⚠️ Important: Please arrive on time for your selected session. Due to the nature of Script Games, we cannot start if players are late. No refunds for no-shows or late arrivals.

[**https://www.meetup.com/san-diego-local-mmo-meetup-guild**](https://www.meetup.com/san-diego-local-mmo-meetup-guild)

Hey all, I'm Tom, 40 years old, looking for more players (25+ years old preferred). This Meetup guild started in late March as a single static group & has grown to 20ish active players for different games and 50 in the discord quickly. We have a friends & family feel with players all over SD in North, South, East, & Central county. The group is a local connection hub for us to hang and meet in person when we can every few weeks & have an MMO many of us play be the glue.

We just finished playing Pantheon for a few months as the pace progression MMO and now are starting [**Project Ascenscion** ](https://ascension.gg/en)(Area 52 realm). Many are planning to play Monsters & Memories when beta opens early next year. There's also some people playing Everquest Online Adventures & a Final Fantasy XI group is starting up. We've had people play Dune Awakening, Everquest: The Hero's Journey, Everquest Project 1999,. A couple people have checked out Ashes of Creation Alpha 2. There is also an organized online board game Sunderfolk group going.

The pace progression game nights are done day of signing up by listing your character(s) you want to play and we hash out the groups before the sessions. This is a social game night for people that want to play 4-8 sessions a month. Some people may play other characters more and have a dedicated alt for the pace progression nights. Girls don't be shy, we have two female group members already and they'd love more female company!

Here is our planned schedule (people still play outside these hours as well):

**Schedule drop-in playtime:**  
Mondays 6:30-8:30pm  
Fridays 7-9pm

**Meetup:**  
Every other Sunday 5-7pm rotating through local bars with bar games, arcade bars, or gastropubs in central SD (Brewski's in Mira Mesa, Coin Haus in La Mesa etc.) We are always looking to add new fun venues in the rotation that are an easy enough drive for everyone.

The pace progression MMO in the group will always be an affordable and accessible one so the pool can easily grow. There is heavy interest in games like Monsters & Memories and at least 4 people have bought the Alpha 2 & Beta 1+2 keys for Ashes of Creation. These are very likely to become pace progression MMOs in the future for the guild when they are easily accessible & affordable. It'd be nice to keep growing a pool that could sustain two MMOs at the same time.

We people that have played Panth, EQ, DAoC, WoW, FFXI, & Vanguard vets. I live in North Park and moved here last June and I've been familiar with it for a long time visiting friends here for years, and it is now home to me.

The idea for the group is something relaxed and casual, and something to look forward to as a nice easy way to be social & have camraderie. I'd like to have people that have some roots down in San Diego so there is more room for some long friendships to form over time.",0,SanDiegoSocial
1mqid99,Interested in walking with a naturalist?,35,1755217785.0,"I don't have anything in particular in mind, but I'd like to gauge interest in exploring a canyon or other open space with someone who could identify plants and animals. I'm an environmental biologist who knows more about ecology, habitats, and regulations more than connecting with other humans, so I'm just putting this out there to see what happens. We could walk around Mirimar Reservoir, visit Los Penasquitos Canyon, or just meet at a local park and see what we find. 

-----

Edit: Thank you everyone for your interest! I will be at the San Clemente Canyon Trail (Marian Bear Open Space Park) off Regents Rd. at 8:00 am on Saturday, August 23. Parking is available in the dirt lot at the trailhead. Look for a tall man with long brown hair wearing a tan long-sleeve shirt at the trailhead. 

This will be an out and back hike from the parking lot, passing under Genesee Ave, and turning back at some point past that, up to 4 miles round trip or so depending on how far we wish to go. The trail is relatively flat, there is some shade, and we will be pausing to look at plants and any wildlife we encounter, so this will be suitable for beginning hikers. Feel free to catch up to us if you arrive later or head out early if you don't want to go the whole way. 

Please wear boots or closed-toes shoes you don't mind getting dirty, sun protection (e.g., sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, long-sleeve shirt, pants), and bring water (and binoculars if you have them). See you there!

------

Edit 2: It's going to be hot, so we'll be back to the parking lot no later than 10:00 am out of an abundance of caution. Water and sun protection are a must!",26,SanDiegoSocial

1mcjkdm,Hey San Diegans!,19,1753814129.0,"Hey, Y'all!

I hope your week and Tuesday are off to a good start, It's been so nice out lately! The weather has been perfect and ideal for summer, I hope it lasts!

I gotta be honest, I've been kinda down in the dumps lately, I don't know why. Maybe it's just a general malaise setting in, a continuous feeling of routine and predictability.

Luckily, I find that the best way to get rid of a slump is to help someone else get out of theirs!

So I would like to offer a helping hand to anyone who feels like they are in a rut, or stuck in on place for whatever reason! Maybe there is a looming task you need to get done but don't know how or where to get started?

We could all use a helping hand from time to time but don't know who to ask or turn to, or maybe because nobody has offered to help? 

Whatever your reason may be I am not here to judge, just help. So whether you need something heavy lifted or moved, maybe your garage needs a bit of cleaning, or your garden could use some weeding, a tree needs pruning? Maybe you just need someone to vent to? I can help!

San Diego has given a lot to me, so it's only fair that I give back from time to time, in whatever way I can.

It's Tuesday! That means taco deals all over SD! So I plan to work hard today and spend my night getting some late night tacos at my favorite place La Fachada!

I consider myself lucky that I get to work outside on days like these. It's sunny, it's warm and there is a steady breeze rolling through. It's so ideal. So make some time for yourself to get outside and experience everything you pay the sunshine tax for!

And if being outside isn't your jam, I get it, I'm an indoor cat myself for the most part. I recently got into video games! I'm terrible at them but they are a lot of fun. I'd like to recommend you check out Blasphemous! It's a Castlevania style game and it's pretty damn cool. Hard as hell though!

Anyway, Here's wishing you all a great Tuesday and an excellent rest of your week!

The boat itself looked super fun, open-air, BYOB, music playing, just a relaxed little ride around the bay while spotting wildlife. It’s run by this company called Tiki Time Bay Tours.

We have a friends & family feel with players all over SD in North, South, East, & Central county.

We are currently playing [Pantheon](https://www.pantheonmmo.com/) as the main MMO, and we are starting to look at playing a different main game. If/when we do want to switch we will have a vote for a new main game focus. We also have some people playing Dune Awakening, Everquest: The Hero's Journey, & Everquest Project 1999. A couple other players are playing WoW Ascension & Warhammer Return of Reckoning, & Ashes of Creation Alpha 2. There is also an organized online board game Sunderfolk group going.

The guild pool play days for the main focus game are done day of signing up by listing your characters you wanna play and I hash out the groups before the sessions. This is for casual players that want to play 6-8 sessions a month along with people that play more have a dedicated lower level alt to play with the pool at the same pacing.

Anyone that wants a preview of the Pantheon if they haven't played can join the discord, say hi, and then you can come hang during at one of our weekly set play sessions for a bit while one of us screencasts to see how you like it. Even if you don't want to play the game you're welcome to hang in the discord and come to the meetups.

They have since cancelled all their events at Mike Hess and are looking for new (non-MAGA) venues. So hopefully they'll connect with a new venue and start running their events with them! Honestly, if there any Queer-friendly breweries in the area, I feel like they'd be a good fit.

Hiya! I’m new in town and was hoping to go to Skip the Small Talk at Mike Hess Brewing in North Park next Monday night because it looks fun [https://www.skipthesmalltalk.com/store/skip-the-small-talk-at-mike-hess-brewing-north-park-monday-june-9-2025](https://www.skipthesmalltalk.com/store/skip-the-small-talk-at-mike-hess-brewing-north-park-monday-june-9-2025)

TBH I’m kinda nervous (I know on the FAQ they say it’s good for introverts but I’m still nervous, what can I say lol). The whole thing is basically you talk to strangers about meaningful stuff, without having to talk about small talk. The whole thing is structured and it’s all based in psychology research, and it’s mainly for people in their 20’s and 30’s, FYI.

1kl9yiq,On the hunt for friends!,26,1747100262.0,"Hey all,

I’m a 37 year old single dad and I haven’t spent time cultivating my community/personal relationships for quite some time. My kids are getting a little older (10/13) so I figured it’s time to step out of my box. I’ve been here for 11 years now, so not fresh and new to SD.

I know a lot of people say to go do hobbies you enjoy and you’ll meet friends, but truth be told I haven’t had those either for a while. And trying to browse through Meetup now feels like I’m just scrolling through literal sales pitches for real estate and marketing. 

I do like hanging out at the pool, going to the beach, hitting up breweries, and going to hockey games, but I’m really open to trying just about anything. 

If anyone is interested in expanding their friend group, shoot me a message! I’m free to hang out most weekends (fri-sun) and Wednesday afternoons. I live in Chula but work in RB so distance isn’t really a problem for me!

Looking forward to hearing from you!",11,SanDiegoSocial
1khzo90,"San Diego: Brand new MMORPG Meetup guild starting L1's on Pantheon fresh start server this Friday! (11 active players, 28 in discord & growing!)",8,1746734459.0,"Here's our discord link (SD Locals MMO Meetup) please come check it out & say hi!  
[**https://discord.gg/AWGAF4gHEm**](https://discord.gg/AWGAF4gHEm)

Hey all, I'm Tom, 40 years old, looking for more players (25+ years old preferred). This guild started in late March as a single static group & has grown to 13 active players and 32 in the discord quickly. We have a friends & family feel with players all over SD in North, South, East, & Central county. We just met our first invited member in-game very recently that asked what the SD in SD Locals was for and he and his girlfriend joined the guild :)

We are currently playing [Pantheon](https://www.pantheonmmo.com/) as the main MMO and are open to changing MMOs down the road. We are about to begin on the fresh start server Veil of Azeris this Friday as level 1's. The guild is to serve as a local connection hub for us to hang and meet in person when we can every few weeks & have an MMO we all play be the glue.

The pool play days are done day of signing up by listing your characters you wanna play and I hash out the groups before the sessions. Our goal would be to have a big enough pool, maybe 15-20 active players & 10+ show up per play day so we can mix & match 2 groups easily if not more down the road.

Some people play more, others are more casual & mostly come to the drop-ins. We have a #lfg and #group-planning channel to get people linked up. We already have a handful of people that play often :)

We are starting to form a culture around Friday being the main play day where the people that play more frequently end up having a Friday character(s) that stay at the level of people who only play Fridays. They either play that lower level alt character or they help powerlevel & protect the group(s) with their higher level character. Sometimes we have 2 groups that hit the same dense camp next to each other with everyone in the same voice channel.

Main drop-in play day:  
Friday 7-9pm

Second drop-in play day:  
Monday 6:30-8:30pm

Meetup:  
Every other Sunday 5-7pm rotating through local arcade bars or gastropubs in central SD (Coin Haus, Gaslamp Coin-Op).   
  
We are currently playing [Pantheon](https://www.pantheonmmo.com/) as the main MMO and are open to changing MMOs down the road. The main MMO in the group will always be an affordable and accessible one so the pool can easily grow. There is heavy interest in games like Monsters & Memories and at least 4 people have bought the Alpha 2 & Beta 1+2 keys for Ashes of Creation. These are very likely to become main MMOs in the future for the guild when they are easily accessible & affordable. It'd be nice to keep growing a pool that could sustain a few MMOs at a time.

Anyone that wants a preview of the Pantheon if they haven't played can join the discord, say hi, and then you can come hang during at one of our weekly set play sessions for a bit while one of us screencasts to see how you like it. Even if you don't want to play the game you're welcome to hang in the discord and come to the meetups. I'm sure people will also play some games on the side together and we have a text channel for people to link up for that, we also have people that like boardgames. Girls don't be shy, we have two female group members already and they'd love more female company!

We people that have played Panth and new players, EQ, DAoC, WoW vets.

I live in North Park and moved here last June and I've been familiar with it for a long time visiting friends here for years, and it is now home to me. It would be great if everyone lived within a 20 minute drive or something easy enough that many of us can meet up at the central SD get together every 2 weeks or so!

The idea for the group is something relaxed and casual, and something to look forward to as a nice easy way to be social & have camraderie. I'd like to have people that have some roots down in San Diego so there is more room for some long friendships to form over time.

The reason we picked Pantheon is because 3 of us have already started playing before and already enjoy it, it's a fresh game, and it is a very social game where all group members have unique and important roles for the group to succeed so there is a lot of teamwork & camraderie! Beyond that there is also lots to talk about - different classes, zones, mobs (enemy NPCs), gear, crafting, new content & game systems etc... Some people describe Pantheon as the modern successor to Everquest 1 & 2 with some combat feelings from World of Warcraft and Vanguard. It is in early access right now, and has a development roadmap and active community. I've been playing since mid December with my cousin and had a lot of fun playing many different classes.

[Pantheon Discord](https://discord.gg/pantheonmmo) (#screenshot-sharing channel in Member Discussion section has lots of great player taken shots, the group profile pic on this page is a player-taken one posted there)

The game and playtime are meant to be the hub & glue of the group. I'd like to have a group where friendships form and people meet up to hang out or play other games together outside the organized playtime.

1kf3x2c,"Looking for Tech Enthusiasts in San Diego – Let’s Meet, Talk IT, and Build Real Friendships",11,1746422455.0,"Hey San Diego,

I'm hoping to connect with fellow IT and tech enthusiasts here in San Diego — not just to talk shop, but to build real friendships, swap knowledge, and maybe even collaborate on cool projects together.

I’ve been in the IT space for about 18 years and have played with just about everything:  
🖥️ Custom NAS setups, homelabs, Windows & Linux servers  
🌐 Networking gear, cloud services, virtualization  
🤖 AI, automation, Docker, self-hosted tools  
🎮 Crypto and gaming rigs, and media centers like Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin

Due to some health and personal reasons, I stepped away from work for about a year. Now that I’m getting back on track and seeking new employment opportunities, I’ve realized how little real human networking I’ve done in the IT space. I don’t really have people around me who share these interests — and that’s what brought me here.

At its core, networking isn’t just about wires and systems — it’s about people. It’s human connections. We connect through our passions, our curiosity, and our willingness to learn and support each other. That’s the kind of network I’m looking to build.

Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, if you're someone who enjoys learning and geeking out with others, I’d genuinely love to chat. Maybe we share resources, explore new tools, help each other grow, or even find new job opportunities along the way.

If this sounds like your vibe, drop a comment or shoot me a message. Let’s turn online messages into offline friendships and make the San Diego tech scene a little more connected. 🙌

I'm looking to connect with someone who’s passionate (or curious) about **podcasting** and has **free time to meet in person** **or online** to talk and brainstorm. Whether you're just getting started or already have some experience, the main goal is to **learn, share knowledge, and bounce ideas** together.

Topics I'm interested in discussing:

* What mics and gear to use
* How to create and grow a podcast channel
* Recording & editing software
* Video podcasting & short clips
* Branding, format, and content strategy
* And all other podcast-related stuff!
* You should enjoy good conversation, have a friendly and positive vibe, and feel comfortable connecting with others—this isn’t for someone who’s super socially awkward or closed off.

Ideally, you’re someone who’s passionate about learning, enjoys collaborating, and is open to sharing ideas. For now, I’m just looking to **network, make friends, and connect with others who share a love for podcasting** or want to explore it as a hobby.

If you’re super busy or have a lot going on in life, this probably won’t be the best fit. But if you’re **local to San Diego**, have some **free time**, and have always wanted to learn about podcasting—or just want to test gear, swap ideas, and build new skills—**hit me up**.

I’m looking for a **serious and passionate** collaborator who loves home media setups, self-hosting, and fine-tuning software like **Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, Docker, virtualization, and more**. This is a **hobby-based** collaboration, but the goal is for both of us to **learn, experiment, and benefit** from working together.

# What I'm Looking For:

✅ Someone **serious and dedicated** about HTPCs, software optimization, and automation.  
✅ Extreme passion for **technology, self-hosted apps, and problem-solving.**  
✅ Located in **Pacific Standard Time (PST) preferred**, but open to remote collaboration.  
✅ Open to chatting regularly and potentially **meeting in person** if local.  
✅ Willing to experiment, test different setups, and push things to the next level.

# What I’m Working On:

* Running a **Windows-based media center** with Hyper-V and multiple services.
* Setting up **ARR apps, automation, and optimizing transcoding (Intel Arc GPU).**
* Managing **large-scale media storage efficiently** across multiple HDDs.
* Constantly testing new software, scripts, and settings to get the best performance.

If this sounds like something you’d **genuinely love to do**, shoot me a message! This isn’t just a casual chat—I’m looking for someone who’s truly into this and wants to build something great together.

Let’s connect, brainstorm, and create an **optimized, fine-tuned HTPC experience** that benefits us both!

Thank you very much!",0,SanDiegoSocial
1jhmbpm,Starting a casual small local MMORPG + Diner MeetUP group in San Diego,7,1742687891.0,"Hey all, I'm Tom, 39 years old, looking for more players (age 25+ preferred). I've just formed a 6 player static group of people to play the game [Pantheon ](https://www.pantheonmmo.com/)on the Havensong server Sundays 7:00-9:00pm together in Discord and cam up together and try to meet once every few weeks at a diner for a coffee or meal. We have played two sessions so far and they have gone great. We have gotten more interest possibly adding two more people soon, and girls don't be shy, we have two female group members already and they'd love more female company!

We can grow the pool into a guild and possibly the new people can form a second static group with their own set playtime and scheduling. In the guild everyone can sub into a static if someone in the static can't make it on the scheduled night, there can be alt groups for times peolpe want to play outside the static group weekly playtimes.

I've met everyone for meet & greets before we played in discord voice/cam, now everyone is the in the discord excited & chatting about the game! We people that have played Panth and new players, EQ, DAoC, WoW vets.

I live in North Park and moved here last June and I've been familiar with it for a long time visiting friends here for years, and it is now home to me. It would be great if everyone lived within a 20 minute drive or something easy enough everyone can meet up at the diner get together when we want, most likely every 2 weeks or so!

The idea for the group is something relaxed and casual, and something to look forward to as a nice easy way to be social & have camraderie. I'd like to have people that have some roots down in San Diego so there is more room for some long friendships to form over time.

Here is the discord link please come check it out & say hi!

[https://discord.gg/8Y3nTKuw](https://discord.gg/8Y3nTKuw)

The reason we picked Pantheon is because 3 of us have already started playing before and already enjoy it, it's a fresh game, and it is a very social game where all group members have unique and important roles for the group to succeed so there is a lot of teamwork & camraderie! Beyond that there is also lots to talk about - different classes, zones, mobs (enemy NPCs), gear, crafting, new content & game systems etc... Some people describe Pantheon as the modern successor to Everquest 1 & 2 with some combat feelings from World of Warcraft and Vanguard. It is in early access right now, and has a development roadmap and active community. I've been playing since mid December with my cousin and had a lot of fun playing many different classes.

I am sure there may be some weeks where we can play a second night if most people can show up and we don't out level the rest of the static too much. I also bet people will have alts etc and may even level much higher with alts if they like playing a lot. Same with some members playing different games together with other members on off days etc... The group is to serve as a local connection hub for us to hang and meet in person when we can every few weeks.

1j9q8db,Happy Hump day San Diego!,9,1741802118.0,"Hey Guys!

Happy Hump Day! The weekend is within sight!

I hope your week is off to a good start, all this rain has been so relaxing, hopefully we get more during spring.

It feels like a perfect day to hit up Balboa Park or maybe even a hiking trail (not me though, I will die if I try hiking). Or maybe grab a pint and do saome day drinking and some disk golf!

San Diego has so much to do that it often gets hard to choose what to do. What's your favorite San Diego simple pleasure?

For me, my favorite would have to be crossing the Coronado Bridge, walking to the ferry dock and watch the city skyline at night. Just sitting on the docks admiring our beautiful city.

There's also all the farmers markets across the city Little Italy, Santee, and Ocean Beach! If you can please support our local vendors, farmers, and makers (just make sure they pay taxes in SD).

It feels like it's getting harder and harder to find spaces where you can just be. A quiet space that you don't have to pay to be in, which is why I appreciate just how much nature there is in San Diego.

We have beautiful walkable neighborhoods all with hidden gems to explore, the walkway on 30th street heading into South Park, any of our beaches, trails, libraries, and the various parklets that are starting to pop up all over the city.

Just in case you've ever wanted to learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons, I am teaching a 101 class later this month on the 22nd. It's a charity event to collect school supplies for underfunded schools in SD. I'd love to see you there.

On the other end, I’ll be manually matching you up with your ideal friend in San Diego! Here’s a link: [https://forms.gle/r7RacuX8DTZiRPFe6](https://forms.gle/r7RacuX8DTZiRPFe6)

Approved by the mods, thank you!

**Hi everyone!**

My name is Maddie, and I’m a lifelong San Diego resident who, honestly, feels pretty lonely.

I’ve noticed all the recent posts about how tough it is to make friends in San Diego. While I know I can’t solve the loneliness problem entirely, I’ve come up with a couple of ways to help.

**1. A Free Friendship Matchmaking Service!**

I’ve set up a completely free way to help people connect. Just fill out this Google Form, and I’ll personally match you with a new friend based on shared interests and preferences! Here’s a link: [https://forms.gle/r7RacuX8DTZiRPFe6](https://forms.gle/r7RacuX8DTZiRPFe6) 

A few important notes:

* I won’t just pair you with the first person I see—I want to make thoughtful matches that actually have a good chance of working. Depending on how many responses I get, it might take some time, but I’m committed to making sure everyone gets at least one match.
* Match emails will come from [**maddie@getflared.com**](mailto:maddie@getflared.com) (check your spam folder just in case!).
* I will **only** use your information for friendship matching—nothing else.

**2. Flared: A Free Friend-Finding App**

I’m also launching Flared, a completely free app designed to help people find friends for specific activities. If you’re looking to connect with others who share your interests, you can check it out at [**https://getflared.com**](https://getflared.com/).

**Why Am I Doing This?**

I’m not trying to promote anything or make money. It’s all completely free and participation is voluntary. I just want to help people make real connections and feel less alone. My goal with all of this is simple: to make it easier for people in San Diego to find genuine friendships.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, I’d love for you to sign up! Let’s make San Diego a friendlier place. ❤️",7,SanDiegoSocial
1j4w22g,Dungeons and Dragons 101 Class! Come learn the absolute basics of D&D while supporting our local underfunded schools! Saturday March 22nd 2pm-6pm @ At Ease Games in Miramar!,21,1741269565.0,"Hello everyone! Just in time for Spring!

I am excited to announce that I will be running another Dungeons and Dragons 101 class at At Ease Games in Miramar this month!

I designed this class to teach you how to get started understanding and playing the game with the absolute basics, in  a relaxed, no-stakes environment.

If you've been wanting to learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons but don't know where or how to get started, this class breaks everything down into small pieces to better help you get started.

The class is open to all ages and experience levels so don't let knowing nothing stop you from attending.  

Here's a rundown of the class.

2pm-4pm: We get into the absolute basics on getting started with creating your character and understanding the more simple mechanics of the game, like what character creation is, what do all these numbers mean? Roll Initiative? Skill Checks? What's that? Everything gets answered in this segment.

-BREAK-

4pm-6pm:  The second half of the class goes into more detail regarding combat mechanics, spell casting, action economy, and world-building.

6pm-7pm I'll be running a short game for anyone still in attendance who want to experience playing the game first hand using the characters you  create!

THINGS YOU'LL NEED: 

- a 7-die set OR dice rolling app 

- something to take notes with (pencil is recommended) 

- I will have handouts for everyone but if you have a 5th edition Players Handbook already I recommend you bring it. 

THAT'S IT!

Bring your friends, family, neighbors,  ANYONE and learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons for a good cause. 

ADMISSION PRICE: 

A donation of new/unopened school supplies that'll be donated to a local underfunded school and/or classroom in the San Diego Unified School District.

Things most often needed included:

-Paper, notebooks, journals, construction paper, fill paper. 

- Pens, pencils, markers, highlighters, crayons, dry erase markers, sharpeners. 

- pencil cases, erasers, rulers, chalk. 

-Backpacks, folders, binders, paper sleeves.

- Learning/developmental games and prizes.

Realistically, we appreciate any and all donations.

If you are not able to make it to the class but would still like to donate to the cause Please feel free to message me and I will provide a way to receive your donation. 

Also, plese be sure to support the venue, At Ease has been kind enough to host me and my classes for years now and I encourage everyone to sample their wares. 

Lastly, If you plan on attending just leave a comment saying ""Going"" so I can get a head count for the day of.

Well, that's all folks! Mark your calendars and set yourself a reminder because you won't want to miss this class!

See you there!",3,SanDiegoSocial

Some of benefits of being in the Riptides:

- Members only exclusive events with the club such as player meet ups
- Pre match tailgates
- Watch parties for away matches 
- Access to the Riptides discord chat

1ayzzv7,San Diego FC - Santee,5,1708795489.0,"
San Diego FC (the new Major League Soccer team) has been hosting some pretty cool events called “Chrome Ball Tour” the point of the event is to drive awareness of the new team. Each event is slightly different, and the Santee event will have signups for 7v7 boys, 7v7 girls, 11v11 women, 11v11 men. Winners will get cash and prizes. The other big this happening at these events are meeting supporters.

If you are not familiar with soccer culture, supporters play a huge role in building the culture of the team. They host events like: painting parties (before each game we will paint a giant canvas to hang at kickoff), chant / drum practice, tailgates, general meetups / mixers, away game watch parties, away game travel, and a lot more. 

Personally I have met some of the best people I have ever met in my life in supporters groups. There is no barrier to entry, so if you think you might want to meet cool people, drink, chant, wave flags, pop smoke, and learn the game, I would encourage you to come meet the supporters!

\- Skateboarding or surfing (I can't actually do either, but it would be fun to give it a go)

zykpcm,Volunteer Opportunities Are Great Ways to Make Friends!,27,1672357949.0,"**One of the most rewarding ways that I have connected with people and built adventurous friend groups has been through volunteering. I wanted to share one of those opportunities here that I think is amazing. I'm sort of blasting it everywhere because I think MAAC is so amazing. It wouldn't let me upload the flyer so I'm just entering the information they send in emails:**

MAAC Project (Metropolitan Area Advisory Committee on Anti-Poverty) is hosting VITA again this Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA). VITA helps qualifying low to moderate income community members receive free basic tax preparation by trained volunteers. The clinic dates for the next tax season will be January 23rd - April 15th in the following locations:

Mondays: Barrio Logan (1-8pm)

Tuesdays: Chula Vista (1-8pm)

Wednesdays: Spring Valley (1-8pm)

Saturdays: Vista (9-5)

Volunteers receive free training to certify in basic and advanced tax law in order to prepare tax returns. Training and filing is pretty easy and doesn't require any post-secondary education or specific skills in finance or math - only that volunteers be 18 or older. Volunteers choose their locations and schedule, have support throughout their time, can receive recommendation letters and opportunities to build their professional network, and up to 18 Continuing Education Credits.

If you are interested sign up here: [https://forms.office.com/r/HcCffZvzXf](https://forms.office.com/r/HcCffZvzXf)

I was made aware that the form link is suspicious, especially for people who don't know VITA is IRS led, and they provide orgs like MAAC with what they need to host VITA filing. This is the MAAC website and you can sign up. The form I shared above is linked at the bottom of their page: [https://maacproject.org/vita/](https://forms.office.com/r/HcCffZvzXf)",7,SanDiegoSocial

It's aiming to another beautiful day here in San Diego and it's Friday on top of it all!

I have been missing out on a lot of what makes San Diego so amazing the last few months due to life and demands so it's nice to surface from time to time.

Summer is in full swing and there is tones to do in our fine city. Balboa Park is looking amazing , the zoo just had a bunch of new plants and flowers installed, the beaches are blowing up with activity. It's been said a million times we are very fortunate to live here.

It's been a while since I've made a post like this. It's been a while since I've been able to reach out and just say hello to you all.

I won't be so long winded in this post, I just wanted to remind y'all how much I love this city and as great as this city is it doesn't mean anything without its people.

We may not live next to each other but that doesn't mean you are not my neighbor and I try to be good to my neighbors whenever I can. Should you find yourself in need of help or need someone to talk to or just someone to listen know that you have someone you can reach out to without judgement.

Times are tough but they are made easier when you have someone willing to help.

Here's wishing everyone an amazing Friday and an incredible weekend .

twvfrx,New in town and going to be hosting regular game nights/grill outs/video game tournaments/kid play dates/adventure bike rides/skateboarding/whatever. Interested?,29,1649166718.0,"I was pretty socially active back in Seattle pre-COVID and I'd like to get back to that good place again. I enjoy meeting new people and hearing their story - and telling a few of my own, and I have some good ones. I work hard to make sure everyone is having a good time, doing something interesting, and the vibe is comfortable.

About me: 40/m/straight white dude, but totally down with every color of the rainbow. We love all peoples, all colors, all genders, all ya'll and then some. I am a left-leaning thinker that finds what people have in common to be far more interesting than how they differ. If you are ultra far-left or ultra far-right, please stay far away from my scene and we'll all be much, much better off. I'm an atheist and don't find religion super interesting. I enjoy drinking cocktails and learning how to make them correctly (sadly, I am just starting to learn how). Beer is good, but I practice a form of ""light"" keto. Why light? Because people don't want to talk about diets, so let's just get back to the pitch. Occasional weed use, mostly edibles, and never when in charge of the kids - and I don't want to smell it either, so no smoking anything indoors. Ah, the kids - I have 3 littles, ages 3/5/5. Today was their first day of kindergarten (!) thanks to an RV trip we took a few months back (crossed the US twice). My wife is a little younger than me and is equally in love with live and living. I batted well above my average when I married her. ;)

Our place: We're in San Marcos for a year, renting a house with a small pool and a generous hot tub. We've got a little space for swimming, grilling, chilling in the backyard and a big couch and comfy chairs in a bright, open living room. There are two large tables (6 and 8 person) for gaming, as well as several more places good for social / group games. Oh, and we have about 100 board games, so you can bring a favorite to share or just show up and jump in on one you've never seen. Parking shouldn't be an issue unless we get into the 6+ vehicle situation, and even then we have ample parking nearby. I also have a good movie collection and love old 90's stuff and everything animated (though I'm not into anime). Food is on the healthier side and we eat meat often, however we're very willing to accommodate any reasonable food request.

What we hope you are: Interested in meeting interesting people. You participate in your life, or at least want to do so more. You're kind to others and you try to be kind to yourself. We have kids, and we've been foster parents, so forever, first, and foremost, we're parents. We won't allow bad people into their life, so don't be a bad person. You want to be part of a group of people that shares experiences, makes connections, tells good stories, and goes home at a reasonable hour because we respect that we're all adults with responsibilities. We're not kids, we don't party like they do. But we do make fun of them and roll our eyes, hard. We have 18 and 22 year old sons back in Seattle. We love them and miss them, so you'll endure a story or two. :P

So, anyone want to hang out? I'm Jesse.",17,SanDiegoSocial

Looking to get more into table tennis and hoping to find some hitting partners. I'd say I'm an intermediate player but I haven't had the chance to play too much recently. I'm willing to play with any level players. Ideally, I'd like to meet up at Balboa Park Activity Center to play, they have a lot of tables there. I believe the first time you play is free, after that is $5 a day or $50 annual membership. 

I get off work around 3pm usually and the activity center usually has table tennis until 830-930 at night. I'm free most weeknights. Let me know if you're interested. Thanks!",9,SanDiegoSocial

As you may know I like to help out around the community and lately I've been wanting to do something special for the SD community.

I want to donate 2 hours of my time to anyone who may need an extra set of hands around the house or just in general.

The two hours can be used for helping around the house with general chores and labor (dishes, laundry, general cleaning), pet sitting, garden care, tree pruning etc...etc.

A few things not covered are any specialized work that requires a permit, tool/equipment rental, any parts and materials needed, and haul-away of waste materials as I don't have the equipment for that.

I'm not promoting anything nor selling anything. No bait 'n hook, no hidden charges just straight up 2 hours of another set of hands.

Hello everyone and Happy Holiday season to you. 

I am exited to announce that I will be hosting a DnD class designed to teach you how to play starting with the absolute basics.

If you've been wanting to learn but don't know where to start or become too overwhelmed by the volume of new info this class will break everything down into small pieces to better help you get started.

Just in time for the holidays!

Admission is any donation of new/unopened animal food or supplies that'll be donated to a local animal shelter to help with the holiday pinch.

The class is open to all ages and experience levels so don't let that stop you from coming! 

4pm-6pm: 101 Class goes into absolute basics and getting started with creating your character and understanding the more simple mechanics of the game.

6pm-8pm: 102 Class goes into more detail regarding combat mechanics, spell casting, action economy, alignment and world-building.

8pm-10pm I'll be running a short One-shot game for anyone in attendance who want to experience playing the game first hand! 

THINGS YOU'LL NEED
- a 7-die set or dice rolling app 
- something you write with (pencil is recommended) 
- if you have the core rulebook I recommend you bring it but I'll have hand outs for everyone. 

THAT'S IT!

Bring you friends, family, neighbors,  ANYONE and learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons for a good cause. 

We'll see you all there!

ou0wdj,The Roving DM. (It's a Dungeons and Dragons thing),15,1627576267.0,"Hello table-top gamers! I hope you're all doing well.

I wanted to let you all know of a project I am starting back up called The Roving DM.

If you've struggled to find a DM for your group then this may be a great way to get a regular game going for you and your crew.

The Roving DM is an ongoing writing project of mine that I have built over the years and used as the main setting for most of my campaigns. I have written as much as I can but need players to interact with the world I've created in order to further develop it.

So if your group has been looking for a DM with no luck then this might be the event for you!

Currently I can commit to 2 monthly sessions in person (outdoors) or online. Meaning I can either run 2 sessions for one group or 1 session for two groups monthly.

If you already have a group but just need a DM drop me a message and we can coordinate schedules and details.

Stay up!",1,SanDiegoSocial

7/31/2021 EDIT - Good morning! The bonfire is on. There's 4 parking lots in the area (3 of them east of Bonita Cove close at 10 pm just FYI, last time we all moved to [the lot adjacent](https://goo.gl/maps/yvBsmhvue4G3DCTr9) to the pit spot around 9:30). 

[Here are some photos to help you find the area](https://imgur.com/a/DLVoxFC). There's a shit ton of firewood around our pit. Thanks u/a_guy_named_vic. We are at the pits across the street from Belmont Park. I'll post what I'm wearing later here so you can at least identify a few of us.

The sequel.

Hi everyone! It's about that time again. [The last bonfire](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiegosocial/comments/o15kvb/summer_bonfire_location_tbd_mission_bay_park/) was a fun, inclusive group of friendly humans. If you're looking to meet a nice group of kind, empathetic, like-minded people after a hellish year - look no forward than the wonderful community of San Diego redditors. As always reach out with any questions. [Consult the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgEpJO4JQj6hOvbtlK5UFgiog_UjCIkeVV7Hqhl2JRY/edit#gid=1095001731) for items you'd like to sign up for.

No glass containers. For any libations on San Diego public beaches, do so at your own discretion and responsibly as *itistechnicallynotlegal*. I will bring some s'mores, utensils and plates, trash bags, and firewood. Bring firewood, any potlucky sides, chair, drinks, etc.

I hope to see you there! It will be BYOB and BYO chair. I won't be able to coordinate pit sitting that day, but I'm gonna get out there early to dump some stuff and risk it. I'm thinking we'll be at the same pit in Bonita Cove again just to make things easy. Parking sucked but worked, just plan accordingly.  Coordinates to be posted.

Also a quick plug to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/AXjzpnEhZM) chat, as the spontaneous meet ups have been *very* active there and it's definitely worth the time to join and check out the event calendar.

Thanks friends!

The Shameful Attack on Helen Woodward,234,1759279455.0,"[Homeless Pets Suffer While Politician Picks a Fight Over Instagram Post - Amy Reichert](https://preview.redd.it/ada1o8t7desf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa535ec6ab503d54b70eb007b7303a5b8015d0f5)

Amy Reichert (Instagram [u/amyforsandiego](https://www.instagram.com/amyforsandiego/)) — the same politician who already lost her last election — is now making headlines for one of the most shameful moves I’ve seen in local politics.

She is urging her followers to **boycott the Helen Woodward Animal Center**, a beloved nonprofit that saves and cares for homeless animals, because one of their employees made an offensive post on their *personal Instagram account*, even after Helen Woodward apologized for their employees post which had nothing to do with them as an organization.  
[https://www.instagram.com/p/DPKu3nmCeaX/?img\_index=1](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPKu3nmCeaX/?img_index=1)

From Helen Woodward  
[https://www.instagram.com/p/DPPB3wsjZRX/](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPPB3wsjZRX/)

Let’s be honest:

* That employee’s post was awful and in poor taste.
* But the shelter itself had nothing to do with it.
* Instead of practicing grace, Amy has turned it into a political circus, encouraging hundreds of people to cancel their donations. The only ones who lose here? The **innocent animals**.

And here’s the staggering hypocrisy: Amy markets herself as a Christian in nearly every post she makes. Yet her actions are the opposite of the values she claims to live by.

* *“The righteous care for the needs of their animals, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.”* — Proverbs 12:10
* *“Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.”* — Matthew 5:7
* *“Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God.”* — Proverbs 14:31
* *“Do not judge, or you too will be judged.”* — Matthew 7:1

Is this mercy? Is this kindness? Is this leadership?

**Who’s next, Amy?** If you’re willing to destroy an animal shelter over one person’s mistake, would you rally your followers to cancel the Ronald McDonald House and stop donations to kids with cancer because of a single employee’s views? Where does it stop?

This isn’t Christian. This isn’t compassionate. This is cruelty masquerading as righteousness — and San Diego deserves better than a bully who puts politics over the lives of innocent animals.

1nu8685,The Often Forgotten History of Bridges over Hodges,95,1759222789.0,"Lake Hodges, or Hodges Reservoir, is a body of water that most San Diegans are familiar with. This is especially true if you regularly commute up/down I-15, and have been around long enough to remember when it had plenty of water.

Before Hodges was a reservoir, it was simply a section of the natural flow of the San Dieguito River. This river carries water from the Volcan Mountains near Julian out to the San Dieguito Lagoon by the Del Mar Fairgrounds. On its way to the ocean, it passes through Lake Sutherland, San Pasqual, and Lake Hodges. The Kumeyaay people lived along its shores, and relics of their presence can still be found today in the form of artifacts such as mortars. 

Prior to damming, two brothers James and Thomas Carroll had adjoining farms in the area. During construction, the dam would sometimes be referred to as Carroll Damn and Reservoir due to many people referring to the area as Carroll Canyon in reference to the brothers. The more official name of the area at the time was actually Crescent Valley. The Carroll brothers sold their land to tycoon Ed Fletcher in 1905. Fletcher began developing plans for the dam. This is the same Fletcher whom Fletcher Parkway and Fletcher hills were named after.

In 1918, Hodges Dam was constructed, turning the river into a reservoir in order to provide water for residents and the booming agricultural industry in nearby areas like Escondido. At the time, Escondido was primarily an agricultural center for growing grapes, and later became well-known for its avocado growth. The dam was partially funded by the Santa Fe Railway which eventually became the Sprinter line from Escondido to Oceanside. The vice-president of Santa Fe Railroad was W.E. Hodges, whom the reservoir was named after. The rail line and dam were large catalysts for early economic growth in Escondido.

In 1919, a small bridge was constructed to cross what was now Hodges Reservoir (photos 1, 3-7, 9, 10) . It served as the Inland Highway until 1931, and then State Highway 71 until 1934. In fall of 1934, the bridge  became part of U.S. Route 395, which provided much the same function that I-15 does to modern San Diego residents. You can still see signs denoting historic route 395 in the area.

On one side of the bridge, there existed a general store (photo 4) which later expanded to include a restaurant and dance hall. Later on, it became a full-fledged fishing resort with cabins, docks, and boat rentals. According to verbal history, kids would frequent the river and cast lines all day. Fish were caught and cooked right by the river. The site of the dance hall and pavilion was destroyed in 1952 with the alignment of U.S. Route 395. Today, the site is currently beneath the entrance ramp for I-15 off of Pomerado Rd.

In 1955 a brand new bridge was constructed across the reservoir (photos 6, 10). 13 years later in 1968, the original bridge was demolished after 59 years of service. In 1969 the bridge was replaced with ""Dual Lake Hodges Bridge"" (photos 8 & 11). At this point, the modern shapings of Pomerado Rd. and the rest of the road system can be seen. The bridge was demolished and replaced again in 1981 to form I-15. Finally, in 2009 the modern portion of the I-15 was completed which widened the old design in order to add lanes. 

It's quite amazing to think about the history of such a seemingly mundane part of our everyday lives. For most now, it is simply an interstate bridge that carries us over the dried bed of Hodges reservoir. But for many in the past, this area meant something very special.

When we got there, sure enough, his Hemi Jeep was hidden off the road on some abandoned property. But it wasn’t alone — right nearby (but not parked right next to it) was a Dodge Hellcat, also hidden behind bushes. Whoever did this knew how to keep cars out of sight from the road.

CHP came back, and both vehicles were recovered. Only damage to my brother’s Jeep was a broken window, and the original keys no longer work as well as minor damage.

Comparing [prevailing](https://www.sdge.com/sites/default/files/regulatory/6-1-25%20Schedule%20EV-TOU-5%20Total%20Rates%20Table.pdf) to [new ](https://www.sdge.com/sites/default/files/regulatory/10-1-25%20Schedule%20EV-TOU-5%20Total%20Rates%20Table.pdf)charges for EV-TOU5 plan (SDGE Delivery, SDCP Generation), delivery charges for all TOUs reduce by approximately 2 cents/kWh.  For Super Off-Peak, that is a stunning 35% reduction from around 4 cents to 2.5 cents.  You add the small remaining non-bypassable and around 8 cents of Super Off-Peak SDCP Generation and you got yourself around 10.5 cents/kWh Super Off-Peak.

Not bad at all.  With the in-pipeline Super Off-Peak extending to weekdays 10 AM - 2 PM,  the only thing that makes sense now is: **get a grid tied battery, or just wait a bit more for the upcoming EVs with bidirectional chargers and you can zero out On-Peak with a small fixed battery and/or your EV**.

Rest in peace Residential Solar.  I did my part for the community over 10 years and will keep the same system for the next 10 under NEM 2.0, but I don't see the ROI anymore.

We ended up paying over $5,000 for the surgery and the scans, bloodwork, etc. but we figured the insurance company would reimburse us. No such luck. Turns out the humane society dropped the ball, and now we are screwed. We are on a fixed income and we were counting on getting that money reimbursed. I have appealed with the insurance company (Freshpet), and I’ve complained to the humane society, but no luck so far.

A little about me and my family:

	•	I expect my base income will be around $125,000
	•	We value safety, reasonable commute, and a decent standard of living

I have a few specific questions I’d love your input on:
	1.	In your experience, is $125,000 enough to live comfortably in San Diego (or close by) as a family of three? Where might the biggest costs bite (housing, utilities, taxes, etc.)?
	2.	Are there neighborhoods or suburbs outside of San Diego proper that are more affordable but still viable (commute, amenities, lifestyle)?
	3.	What tradeoffs should I expect (commute time vs cost, neighborhood vs safety, public transit vs car)?
	4.	Any “hidden costs” or surprises I should be aware of when moving from the East Coast to SoCal?",25,SanDiegan

1ntq56x,The Digital Coupon Ordinance goes into Effect October 1st: Email from Vons,15,1759171072.0,"""Dear Valued Customer,

We want to inform you about a new city ordinance that may affect your shopping experience at our 29 City of San Diego stores.

Beginning October 1, 2025, the City of San Diego’s Digital Coupon Ordinance, also known as the Grocery Pricing Transparency law, will go into effect. This ordinance requires that any digital discount offered to customers (other than personalized loyalty deals) must also be available in a non-digital format to provide equal access for all customers, including those who may not use smartphones or apps.

Since many of our deals are sponsored and supported by manufacturers, cooperation with our vendors is necessary. Unfortunately, as of today, some vendors and manufacturers have not provided alternative formats for their digital offers resulting in a reduced number of promotions and digital deals available in the impacted San Diego stores. The addresses of the impacted stores are provided for your reference [here](https://www.vons.com/content/dam/docs/san-diego-coupon-ordinance-impacted-stores-use.pdf).

We understand this may be disappointing and are actively working with our vendor partners to explore solutions that maintain the value and savings you expect.

Thank you for your understanding and continued loyalty. If you have any questions or need assistance accessing available offers, our store teams are here to help.

Sincerely,

Vons""",27,SanDiegan
1ntpv12,Vons Response to San Diego Grocery Ordinance,95,1759170443.0,"Today, Vons sent an email saying that, in order to comply with the San Diego grocery ordinance, that all coupons must be offered in paper format, and that the manufacturers they partner with don't do that (or haven't had the time to adapt to it), so a subset of coupons (digital manufacturer coupons) we otherwise would have been getting, we now won't. At the time, this was something I said could happen as a result of city council actions, and it has.

This seems to differ from Ralphs. To my understanding, Ralphs will still offer digital manufacturer coupons in its app and on the website. I am unsure about other grocery retailers. Local grocery retailers seem to differ in their exact interpretation of compliance, in reasonable ways. Ralphs and Food 4 Less have a scan sheet for the weekly digital deals, which are store coupons.

On the large, I'd say there are more mfr coupons than store coupons in the app. Maybe 1-2 dozen of them are store coupons: the best deals of the week. The long tail of them are mfr coupons.

So, I would say if you're planning on doing deals involving mfr coupons, that you are better off avoiding Albertsons and affiliates (Vons/Albertsons/Pavilions) until things change.",48,SanDiegan
1ntnofk,Thanks for ruining my day off,375,1759165546.0,"I was having a nice morning off work riding my bike down El Cajon Blvd to go the zoo a bit after 9am.  Traffic was light since most people are already at work. 

I was riding in the right most lane where there are sharrows painted intermittently in the road to signal to cyclists where to bike to avoid getting doored and to signal to cars to watch out for cyclists. 

All of a sudden some jabroni comes up behind me and lays on his horn. So I honk mine and signal him to go around because the other lanes were completely clear. He continued to honk at me so I got over to the other lane since he seemed like he just wouldn’t let up. We wound up at a red light so I was next to him, having switched lanes. 

I’ve been trying not to engage with these fuckers because people are crazy but I’ve had a stressful couple of months so I’m just like “WHAT?!” at his window. He rolls his window down and yells “Are you trying to fucking die you CUNT? GET OUT THE ROAD.”

Mind you I’m on my ebike riding completely undistracted. Not even music or Google Maps. Just biking along abiding by all the rules of the law. And other than this fucknut, the roads are completely clear. 

I’m just like “I’m allowed to ride here! Read a fucking driver’s manual.” The light turns green and he drives off OVER a sharrow and I honk at him and say “HAVE A GOOD DAYYYYY” and he immediately turns right. I’m hoping because he saw the sharrows and realized he’s a fucking dumb ass. 

Now I’m calming my nerves over a latte before I go to the zoo. I have been bike commuting for 20 years and generally do not feel unsafe riding on ECB. Literally the only thing that put my life in danger was that entitled ass dick scaring and distracting me with his honking and shitty behavior. If you’re uncomfortable driving around cyclists, switch lanes and go along your way. Honking at them will not solve your problems and is likely to cause an accident. ",166,SanDiegan

1nt4w26,FREE Coaching from a Student Coach,9,1759107775.0,"Hi everyone,

I’m a grad student at the University of San Diego working on my Master’s in Leadership Studies. This semester I’m taking a hands-on course in leadership coaching, and I’m looking for **two volunteer clients** to practice with.

**What’s coaching?**  
Coaching is about creating a supportive space to help people move from where they are now to where they want to be. Coaches don’t give advice, rather they ask thoughtful questions that spark reflection and new ideas. The goal is to help clients gain clarity, discover their own solutions, and take steps toward meaningful goals.

**How is this different from therapy?** 

Therapy tends to focus on the past. Therapists help you process past issues and trauma. Coaching focuses on the future, setting goals, and self improvement. Coaches don’t diagnose or treat. They ask questions and facilitate self-discovery.

**What you’d get out of it:**

* Focus on an area of your life or work you’d like to move forward
* Gain new perspectives and clarity
* Try out coaching for free in a supportive, no-pressure setting 

**Commitment:**

* Four 30-minute Zoom sessions between now and December
* Sessions are recorded for my learning only (shared just with me, my mentor coach, and my two professors) 

**Interested?**  
Send me a message, and we can set up a quick 5–10 min call to go over informed consent and book our first session.

Happy to answer questions here too. Thanks for reading!",2,SanDiegan

The issue is I now need a job, and there has been no lack of trying. I am currently a TIG welder, working with stainless steel, aluminum and occasionally mild steel. I do a lot of fabricating as well, I'd say it's a 50/50 mix. Over the last 3 months, I have put out over 85 applications, and yet almost none are being viewed or even getting back to me. I've tried Indeed, LinkedIn, zip recruiter and even just calling/emailing shops. I even have just been applying to other jobs that I would be qualified for (I was an assistant manager at Jamba for 3-4 years and did a great job leading a team). And yet nothing.

I have also applied to the local 206 for their apprenticeship program. Their test is in October, but yet it's a lengthy process to get in, and I'm not even sure I'll get in. So I need help. If anybody knows of any place actively hiring, I'd be happy to give a hand. I don't mind commuting any distance; and I don't mind any shift. Day, mid or night I'll do anything. And I don't want to be picky, but I'm looking for something that will pay more than $23/hr. I'm grateful for any job but I do need a bit of a living wage and can't be upside down on bills, as we all know life has gotten pretty expensive lately.

1nmy4w4,Pickleball at a public parks. Are we in the wrong?,141,1758475977.0,"My friends were given a stern talking-to by a neighbor when we were setting up our pickleball equipment on a public basketball court around 8:30am. She cited the noise ordinance that was posted on the court which read ""NOISE OR MUSIC AUDIBLE MORE THAN 50 FEET PROHIBITED"". We politely informed her that games of sport are allowed on a public court at a public park, and that this ordinance was aimed at amplified sound, I.e. loud music over a speaker. This makes sense considering the noise that would come from a pickup basketball game or even just one person dribbling a basketball on the court would easily be audible over 50 feet (for reference, this is about the WIDTH of a basketball court). One other detail is that this park is literally right next to an elementary school, so it seems like this neighbor has a problem with the type of noise that comes from pickleball (which is understandable, but still). 

I am aware that the city has pickleball lines drawn on several courts throughout the county, but these places are often busy and we wanted to have a free space of our own to play. Is there anything specific that forbids us from going to a public basketball in a residential neighborhood to play pickleball? ",186,SanDiegan

—
This person’s dog ran up to me and bit my leg while I was riding my bike near Rancho Santa Fe. She did not have a leash, did not control the dog as it tried to come after me again, and she left while refusing to give me information. Two small and deep punctures bled, and the whole calf muscle is sore today. 

The bite has been reported to county animal control and the RSF HOA. They can not do anything else without information. At the very least this person needs to confirm their dog is immunized and then she needs to fix my handlebars from when the dog took me down. 

I think the dog’s name is Lucy. 

I posted this in another sub and started to get great advice before moderators deleted it. If she comes forward, apologizes, fixes my bike, and takes Humane Society training seriously, I will avoid a suit. If I have to track her down and get the same response as I did yesterday (screaming at me and not taking responsibility,) I’d love the name of a San Diego dog bite lawyer.

1nijqkl,Long term reptile boarding.,6,1758034467.0,"Hi r/sandiego friends! I’ve recently had some major life changes and am going to have to move in with my parents for a few years. 
I have a pet snake who I love dearly but my mom is deathly afraid of snakes so he won’t be able to come with me when I move in with them. 

Does anyone know of a reptile boarding service that’s more geared towards long term? Every place seems to charge per night but I’m looking more per month/year.

Am I crazy to try to board him or should I just rehome him? And if that, what’s a good organization to go through for that?
Thanks!",13,SanDiegan

1ni7uvi,Looking for dashcam footage – Eastbound 94 freeway around 5:55 PM today. (125/94 split),71,1757996688.0,"Hi all, I’m hoping someone has dashcam footage of an incident that happened today (around 5:55 PM) on the eastbound 94 freeway.

A car had completely stopped in the left lane. I was driving a white Jeep Grand Cherokee and had to slam on my brakes, barely stopped with about a foot to spare. Unfortunately, the car behind me couldn’t stop in time and hit me, which caused my Jeep to tap the stopped car in front.

Thankfully, everyone involved is okay.

The driver of the front car got out briefly, then got back in and tried to drive off! Another truck had to block him in to stop him from leaving the scene!

Huge thanks to the guy stopping him! To at least get the guys information.

CHP took report.

If anyone was in the area and has dashcam footage, especially of the front car stopping or the moments leading up to the crash, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance!",6,SanDiegan
1ni6unf,Hit and Run Help,46,1757993533.0,"I was in a hit and run earlier today. I was relying on my dashcam footage to show the license plate but it did not. Here's the info I have:

* 163 N on-ramp at Genesee
* 4pm
* 09/15/2025
* Utah license plate
* White male early 40s

I chased him over to the Balboa East (exit 21) before losing sight of him. Initially, he got out of his car but we were blocking the on ramp so I told him very angrily to get back in his car and pull off to the side somewhere. He refused and didn't like my attitude so he decided to protest by driving off which is a felony, by the way. I had been in an accident a couple months prior and someone vandalized my car shortly after that, so as you know, I'm pissed. Even more so now that he's a hit and run case.

**Vehicle Info**

* Volvo xc70
* Mounting racks
* Tan
* Utah License Plate
* Probably 2007 to early 2010s

The off-ramp was closed and coned off.  I figured I would get off at Clairemont Mesa Blvd instead.  Coudn't do that, it was closed as well.  Kept going north.  The 52 east ramp was also closed. Kept going. Ah, the 52 west ramp appeared to be open, great!  Went west and was planning on get off at Convoy at the landfill exit and double back.  Nope, it was closed as well.    
  
Kept going west on 52 and a lit sign on the right said ""805 SB Connector closed"".  Turned out it wasn't, maybe they hadn't got to it yet, so I was able to get on 805 south.  Immediately saw a sign that said Balboa exit was closed, so I was able to get off on Clairemont Mesa Blvd and head east.

Made it all the way to CMB and the 163 bridge and saw that there was no one around on the exit, although it was coned off like I had seen before (and couldn't exit).  I was able to continue east and get to where I needed to go by doubling back, etc., but what a cluster!  I've never seen so many off-ramps closed at the same time...Be aware!",10,SanDiegan

Just hoping that someone would be able to point me to the right direction.

My partner & I's lease in NP has gotten too expensive (<500sqft, $2800) and while I (think) we have the option to stay, I am fully expecting another increase in rent, which we can't afford. I filed for bankruptcy at the end of August, and did not realize at the time how my timing would affect apartment hunting. I had to file due to divorce, a cross country move, and several health problems. I technically make too much to qualify for any housing programs, so I don't have too many options outside cold calling apartments and rentals across the county. 

I have family in the area, but can't move in with them as I have two ESAs (\~20lb dogs) and they all have other dogs. I have a cosigner/guarantor already lined up. We've also considered living in a long term hotel/rental if I can't find an apartment to move into.  I've looked at getting roommates as well, but that's a completely different battle that I'm not sure I'm ready to fight.

It’s almost here! San Diego International Airport (SAN) is putting the finishing touches on its new Terminal 1, with the first flights arriving the evening of **September 22**. Before that, the public is invited to get an exclusive first look during a **Community Reveal: Open House** on **Sunday, September 14, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.**

“We’re so excited to give the community the opportunity to experience firsthand all that our new Terminal 1 offers before it officially opens,” said Kimberly Becker, President & CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “We appreciate the patience and support from our neighbors and travelers during construction. This is San Diego’s airport, and we are proud to share it with everyone.”

No registration required — just show up and bring a friend! This free, family-friendly event offers a self-guided tour of the new terminal, where guests will experience the modern design, spacious layout, and state-of-the-art amenities that will enhance the customer experience and soon welcome millions of travelers.

Airport staff will be available throughout the terminal to answer questions and help guide visitors during the event. Select concessions will also provide complimentary samples, giving attendees a taste of the flavors that will be available when the terminal opens.

Parking is available in the Terminal 1 Parking Plaza. The first three hours are free with validation — be sure to bring your ticket with you. Directional signs will guide attendees to the Open House entrance, located on Level 1 of the new Terminal 1 at 3301 N. Harbor Drive, San Diego, CA 92101.

We’ll have two young kids with us and my sister-in-law who’s in her 20s. So we’re hoping for ideas that are family-friendly but are also maybe more interesting for someone younger who wants to experience the local vibe.

1neu70z,Meters aren't meant for residents or employees to park all day/night long??,107,1757652383.0,"https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/san-diegos-60-surge-parking-for-special-events-outpaces-cost-of-ticket/amp/

""Director of Communications Rachel Laing provided us with the following statement: “Metered parking is supposed to be a demand-management tactic above all. It’s in commercial areas in order to ensure customers can park, do business and move on. It’s not supposed to be for employees or residents to park all day long. 


Business groups like the Gaslamp Quarter Association, which is supposed to represent the businesses in the Gaslamp, should be embracing tactics that make it easier for those who aren’t attending big special events to find parking downtown to patronize Gaslamp businesses instead of advocating for bartenders to use that incredibly limited resource all night."" 

So, don't put meters in residential areas- densely urban or otherwise, if that's not what you expect us to do. Or tell us, where exactly we should park instead? (NO, NOT EVERYONE CAN GIVE UP THEIR FREAKIN' CAR, so don't even start.)

And where *should* the employees of said businesses park all night without giving up 1/2 their shifts' pay AND GET HOME SAFELY afterwards, which could mean anywhere from 11pm-3am? The trolley- or public transportation in general- isn't even an option for many of those late night employees. ",68,SanDiegan

Essentially arrived very late and even kept me in the car even after arriving for 30 minutes to talk about his life and backstory even life lessons I never asked for and already knew but when I tried telling I had to go he leaned his chair back and continued on with lore I didn’t ask about, making me late to class in general.

I felt very uncomfortable with this situation as well this all started off when he told me he has a granddaughter with the same name as mine then the topic he spoke about was changed constantly and even confessed he’s been in a few accidents while driving with passengers and without them and that didn’t even help since he told me that while we were on the freeway also he kept looking back at me while driving to talk😔 and when I tried correcting him to where to drop me off he changed topic and continued.

1nc3py9,Restaurant surcharges at the airport,56,1757375158.0,"I found this little nugget in a U-T article today:

>Food and drink purchases will also include a 2% surcharge, all of which goes directly to the workers. The levy is a hangover from the pandemic years when there were labor shortages in the hospitality industry and employers were having to pay higher hourly wages to find workers. Airport Authority board members agreed to keep it in place for the new Terminal 1 in order to ensure that experienced workers from Terminal 2 would relocate for the startup of the new concessions, said \[Kevin\] Westlye, who lobbied for the surcharge.

[https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/08/food-in-san-diego-airports-new-terminal-is-local-local-local-although-there-is-one-mcdonalds/?share=die0rhemeo2deniadccn](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/08/food-in-san-diego-airports-new-terminal-is-local-local-local-although-there-is-one-mcdonalds/?share=die0rhemeo2deniadccn)

First of all, kudos to the U-T for talking about surcharges! They need to do this every time they talk about a restaurant that has them.

But shame on the Airport Authority. Rather that just achieving the same goal by setting the menu prices 2% higher, the Airport Authority decides it's just fine to hide it in a surcharge. I guess I will be packing my own food next time I go to the airport!",37,SanDiegan
1nc3jqo,Liberty Station/ USS Recruit DUI and Crash 9/6,290,1757374705.0,"This incident occurred at around 4:40p on Saturday 9/6, between the USS Recruit (2558 Laning Rd, San Diego, CA 92106) and the Homewood Suites. **I told all of the following to the police on site, as well at the detectives and all the video and photos I have was submitted on site as evidence for the case.**  

Starting off I know there was an earlier post about this, but wanted to add my own perspective and photos as I was also there with my 5 year old son and need to write all this out. Now there are new spots and articles out I know, but just want to get all this out there too. 

I first noticed the blue BWM which arrived at the same time as me at about 4:10p, as they were in the parking lot (about 100 ft away from the site of the crash) because she was driving slow then abruptly stopping several times before finally pulling sloppily into a handicapped spot nearest to the water. While in the spot (and in park) you could hear the engine revving sporadically, which was odd but seemed like a car issue more than an impaired driver at the time, but I still took mental note of it. 

Then after playing with my son around the ship and same area as the crash, at about 4:35 I head a screech the sound of a small crash, like a car hitting something and then hitting the breaks suddenly. I then remembered the blue car and thought I bet it's the same car, so I went with my son over by the Boil Daddy Restaurant farther away, but rather cautiously as I was not sure what was up with the driver. I walked by the stuck car **(PIC 1)** recording a video at with my phone down, so I could get the plate and situation documented. The car then remained there for a minute or so, not moving and no sounds coming from the car. 

I then called the police at 4:37p to report the strange behavior (earlier and now) and told them the car description and area. As I was doing that she then got unstuck and drove away slowly, 10mph max heading towards the end of the parking lot where she stopped suddenly again and sat there for maybe 30 seconds before hopping the curb at the back end of the USS Recruit and slowly continuing down the large pedestrian area towards the eventual crash site. I was on the line updating the dispatcher and saying that I see them heading towards people and they better already send a unit. 

Then she tried to curve around the area and hit a bolted down bench where she seemed stuck. I was about 100 ft behind at this point as I was following the car on foot while on the line. Then out of nowhere you hear the car accelerate 100% get unstuck from the bench, hit another bench, drive through 2 bushes before swerving and ending up crashing into the tree. From my angle (behind the path) I could not see that anyone was hit until I saw a male carry the girls body away from the car to some soft ground. I let dispatch know that a child was hit and I would try to see if other victims and the status of the girl. She was there with her mom and little brother (3?) who was also on a scooter but only the girl was injured. My guess is the mom reacted and grabbed the little one, then the car hit both scooter and the 5 yo girl. This was about 4:40p, and I will not be describing any of her injuries besides what is already known from news and other posts (head trauma).

The whole area had about 20 people around (soon many more) 2 men were helping the girl, I handed my phone to one of them so he could describe her injuries to dispatch. Meanwhile the driver seemed pissed off and lost, had no idea she hit a kid and did not go over to check on her at all, she just stood by her car door (some people were nearby in case she made a run for it) she was cussing at bystanders and also made a couple phone calls before police arrived. 

The first responder arrived at approximately 4:44 (a SDPD officer who had come from the Midway Area) went straight to the girl to offer first aide, may people pointing out the driver but rightly so he want to the victim. The paramedics arrived shortly after at 4:47. And then a flood of SDPD and SD Harbor Police steadily for the next 10 minutes. 

The girl was assessed, secured and in the ambulance by 4:53p **(Pic 2)**. And that is the most important part of all this. I stayed for about 2 hours after the crash along with 3 other witnesses to tell our stories to the sergeant, and detectives. During this time they marked off the crime scene and taped off large portions of the area, you can see the two destroyed scooters and a girls show in (**PIC 4**). They also searched the car and found a half empty bottle of Liquor (**Makers mark? Pic 3),** they also kept her in a squad for 1.5 hours before doing the filed sobriety tests (**PIC 5**) and eventually ending up in handcuffs again (**PIC 6**).

Not as a pat on my own back because the girl is still fighting for her life, but as a lesson to us all and to myself. IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING. If you notice strange behavior or driving do not hesitate to call the non-emergency police line (call is still recorded and can be instantly upgraded to emergency with the same dispatch system), you never know what could happen next, and in this case something absolutely bizarre, terrible and criminal occurred.

Essentially, we're dealing with a housing rental where while we do have a mini-split in the living room, the bedrooms themselves get very cold at the night. 

The property manager, came by, measured the temperature in our rooms and agreed it was under 70 degrees. Then he said the owner of the house doesn't want to put in a mini-split (in the bedrooms) and we have to just rely on space heaters. 

The problem is that space heaters trip the circuit breaker and they're expensive and dangerous to be running all night.

I am forever seeing Padre fans pissing on the street, side walk--- Literally dropping trash and littering their cups and food trash like its a landfill.  

i'm also over the traffic jams right by the park as well when I'm just trying to get to the dispensary before it closes at 9 PM 

It's incredible. A day last week I was walking my dogs and heard two gentlemen who just parked to come to a game talk about how disgusting downtown is and how trash it is and all the homeless etc. etc. and there was literally some guy in a Padres Jersey a block over pissing on the wall of a restaurant on the side. Daytime game that hadnt even started yet

so I'm happy about the price hike for the parking meters. 

for all the shit people talk about downtown, the ones who don't live here, y'all sure are up in arms about having to pay for parking to come be here. stay your asses home and watch the game or concert on tv or whatever.

1n9p525,"Reddit friends,  I have a tough  situation and need some advice work and employee related-",0,1757128922.0,"Posting this  in r/SanDiegan because I am a local, and maybe after reading this, there is someone out there to offer this person some work? Also you all tend to be an understanding, well thought out group of individuals. What field they work in I will answer in PM only- to protect identity.

Without divulging  too many details- Interviewing for an open position at my company North County San Diego - we have  a few very strong candidates- one of them, we vibed with  far better than with than the others. However this candidate is currently tied for being   the most qualified that has interviewed. Great person, extremely  smart, personable, skilled, the whole nine yards.  There are some valid reasons why they are not the most qualified for the position though, so some decisions and further  evaluation is needed.

The BIG issue

When I was explaining that it is a 3 step process and that we are not hiring on the first or second interview- candidate disclosed they are sleeping in their vehicle and would want/ need an advance in the way of a working interview. Also some mentions of a criminal history came out , not too many details and it may not be a big deal, as well as issues at their last job. Anyhow-  because I feel for the fellow human and always try to help , at times to a fault, I have been taken advantage of before- badly- I am wondering what to do . The level of personal details really was off putting, especially because I felt like it was a bit forced on me. this person does belong to a traditionally marginalized group of  people, so my protector instinct was out in full force, especially when hearing a few details of a brave existence that I am very familiar with .

What also is getting to my soul a bit is that the position was advertised as in person work.  During the phone screening, candidate asked if they could work  out of office, if acceptable because they  freelance. I explained that we want people here in person, to see the reaction. Then as the interview progressed- it went to -"" I want all of my computer stuff here, because I do not do computers in my off time, and its in the van , I can set it up now, and start tomorrow. "" Other situations came out - they are on disability , totally broke and I can pay them as an employee partially and then also pay  certain hours as R &D, with a lot of discussion about our tax savings, payroll  and incentives. That also bothered me, as thats not something I want to ever talk about. Their own developing business was also brought up, and how we could just invest in that. NGL, its an AI model that is very important and looks promising. But I do not want our company info used to just feed an AI machine either.

It bothers me that they are in this situation. I do not want a hiring decision to be colored by me feeling bad and wanting someone to go forth in life. I  also want to help.

If I didn't hire the candidate, and the strong candidate did not work out- I would like to go back to this person and offer, if they were still looking. But I need a person who works on just our  tasks, and leaves the big picture out. We pay very well, but we are also a smaller office with a very large field presence. i cannot worry about anyone here   and whether they are on task.

I do think there is a security issue here at the office with the amount of systems knowledge the candidate has, and I would have to hack/tamperproof certain sensitive computers here with a professional in order to let this person work here and still let me sleep at night. I knew it right away- gut feeling. that would require me hiring an IT professional and taking a few weeks to lock things down.

I may be missing out on the next step to really growing my company,  but something is just nagging at me.

Should I ignore the personal details and red flags and just offer a remote , 1 off freelance job to see how they do ? Even though that is not technically what I am advertising?

Advice, thoughts? I am actually still at work 3 hours later than usual. and really upset by this because I have never faced this situation.

TL/DR- please do - I am truly in need of advice

I just love the atmosphere and vibe there, that and well the crowd is very friendly and never had a bad experience.

But I'm interested in looking for Bars similar to Whistle Stop in terms of Atmosphere & Vibes and also the crowd, I'm very extroverted and enjoy talking to people so any Bars that match that vibe that you guys can reccomend me?

I can’t wrap my head around why, in 2025, we’re still treating this as a form of “entertainment.” These animals don’t get a choice. They’re pushed to the limit for gambling and ticket sales, and when their bodies give out, the “solution” is a lethal injection behind the barns.

It’s not an isolated incident either — around 500 horses die every year in U.S. racing and training.

I’ve lived here since July 2023- a year in North Park, and a year now in Hillcrest. 

I’m moving, again. I don’t usually move around this much. The first move was to save some money, and this move is due to a crazy neighbor getting in my space and yelling at me about the fact that I accidentally missed a piece of dog poop. 

Anyway…

I am looking at two homes, one in the Castle neighborhood of City Heights and one in the south Swan Canyon neighborhood in City Heights. 

The Castle one is around 41st and Thorn. Street parking. 

The Swan Canyon one is around Fairmount and Maple. I haven’t been to this one yet. Designated parking. 

Am I nuts to be looking in these areas? The homes themselves are great. But every time I tell someone I’m looking in City Heights they grimace in response. 

I don’t tend to go out at night, am a bit of a homebody, and use cameras, locks, etc. 

A lot of posts say it’s not that bad, and it depends on which pocket you’re in- some posts essentially say I’m going to die in the first 30 days.

It's a California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) filing.  Specifically, a ""Notice of Exemption"" because ""no alteration to the existing use of the property.""  

Filed by: San Diego County Regional Airport Authority

Project Description. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority will purchase the existing Wally Park parking facility at the southwest intersection of Kettner Boulevard and Sassafras Street and continue to use the parking structure for airport parking. The parking garage was constructed in 2005 and is comprised of 3 levels with 770 parking stalls, and a 21,780 square foot surface lot with 64 parking stalls. The Airport Authority will utilize the parking facility for airport users, including passengers and employees. Airport users will be shuttled to and from San Diego International Airport using a fleet of airport-operated buses using existing access points to public streets. Consistency with Airport Master Plan. The property is located off of Airport property under the planning jurisdiction of the SDCRAA and outside of the Airport Master Planning jurisdiction. However, parking in the proximity of the airport will be used to serve airport users, including passengers and employees.
