1npwrj9,How to put a few hundred dollars (+ a few volunteers) to good use for those who are under-resourced in our community?,13,1758772180.0,"I have a few hundred dollars stashed away from birthdays and Christmas money received over the years. I wanted to do something special with it but was never sure what. Well, I finally decided that I really don't need to spend it on myself, so I'm looking for a local organization that is doing good work in the community where I could not only donate it, but preferably also volunteer in some capacity to carry out whatever I was funding. I'm sure I could find a few (or more) friends to join me if a few other bodies were needed.

An example of what I mean would be sponsoring a meal for the unhoused, then serving the meal with other volunteers. I know Jewish Family Services does this.

However, I would ideally like to sponsor something that would give someone the resources to better their life situation in a longer-term capacity than feeding them a single meal. I'm not sure of what all is out there, but maybe paying for materials for some sort of course or workshop could be an example?

Is anyone aware of any organizations or community groups that would be a good fit for what I'm looking for?

If it sparks any ideas, I'm passionate about helping immigrants, low-income and/or single-parent households, the unhoused, and also the natural environment. I'm a solopreneur so helping someone start a business in some way could also be cool since I'm in business for myself, too.

I know I'm not going to save anyone or change the world with this donation/volunteering, but this money is special to me in its own way so it would mean a lot to me to be able to use it in a meaningful way as I've described here. If it's an especially good fit, I'm also open to considering something that would turn into an ongoing volunteer engagement (though the funds would be a one-time thing).

Thank you in advance!",3,SanDiego

I got a fix-it ticket for two burned out tail lights. I fixed them and went to the local sheriff's office to have the fix approved. Since I don't want to drive to Vista, they told me to call Vista Traffic Court to find out how much to send them by mail. 1) they only answer the GD phone from 8:30am to 11:30am. WTF IS THAT?!? 2) the recorded message said to go to their website www.sdcourt.ca.gov. The only thing I can find online there is to pay the full fine of $193. I was under the impression the fixed tail lights would be cheaper than that. Plus, the wording online appears that I am paying a full fee without contest or something.

So I pulled back around and took a video and pictures of them. I don’t know who they are, but I talked to the mini mall’s private security, who said they had already contacted law-enforcement.

I do a lot of fabricating as well, I'd say it's a 50/50 mix. Over the last 3 months, I have put out over 85 applications, and yet almost none are being viewed or even getting back to me.

I have also applied to the local 206 for their apprenticeship program. Their test is in October, but yet it's a lengthy process to get in, and I'm not even sure I'll get in. So I need help. If anybody knows of any place actively hiring, I'd be happy to give a hand. I don't mind commuting any distance; and I don't mind any shift. Day, mid or night I'll do anything.

They are getting washed 2x a week with flea shampoo, bought those expensive ointments that you put once a month, and they just won’t leave. 

I talked to my mom and she’s been dealing with the same thing with her dog. She takes her dog to the vet in TJ and apparently, the vet said that there’s some sort of super flea going on because lots of people are bringing their cats/dogs for flea treatments that seem to be resistant to everything. 

I’m taking my cats to the vet tomorrow to get a vaccine they’ve gotten before for fleas, and just going to continue on with bathing them.

I go to UCSD but the campus gyms are always packed, so I’m considering getting a membership elsewhere. If your apartment has a gym, that could be a great option too. I’m mainly focused on cardio (treadmill, cycling, running/jogging) with a mix of strength training.

Outside the gym, I’d also love to team up on meal planning and help keep each other consistent. If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, feel free to DM.

This is especially for you folks that are long-term renters, paying below market, in units where the original owners sell due to age, and the developers out there hungrily looking for these older apartment complexes to evict you, paint the walls and re-rent for 100%+ more. They cannot just kick you out. 

Please look at your rights. San Diego's tenant protections are only in the actual metro of SD. 

California has its own protections that are pro tenant, but San Fran, LA and finally SD build upon the state's laws and enact greater protections. 

Im not going to debate the merits of the law.  Not going to get into the downside or upside of these laws. You all want to debate the pros and cons here- please feel free to have discourse/debates/fights about the protections. 

Im just here to say if you are a renter and in any way losing your place through no fault of your own- look at our laws that were enacted in June of 2023.

Should someone have something valid and want to speak to a lawyer please call around and get any and all free consultations you can and go from there

Rent for a *basic* one-bedroom in North Park or Normal Heights is pushing $2,200+, gas hovers around $5, groceries are insane, and parking tickets feel like a tax for existing. I make decent money on paper (around $65k), but it feels like I’m just surviving, not living.

What makes it worse is that even when you’re responsible, this city still punishes you. I had one late rent payment last year when I was between jobs, literally 12 days late, and it tanked my credit. Now, even though I’ve never missed a payment since, landlords want to treat me like I’m a liability. I’ve been asked for 2 months’ rent upfront *plus* a cosigner for an apartment that’s barely bigger than a closet. I have literally no idea how to build my credit score back again.

I love the weather, the beaches, the food, all of that’s amazing. But honestly, what’s the point if you’re constantly stressing about money? I can’t be the only one wondering if San Diego is really worth it anymore.

Edit: I get it. I really get it, that $65k is not enough to live here and I'm trying my best to get that number up. But some things are out of my hand which wont let me move out. For the credit score part, some good folks DMed debit cards that report to credit bureaus like Fizz and Chime. I'll look into them give a try.

My understanding is that since the amount of surplus kwh is actually the same though, the amount of compensation I’d get back is the same for either plan, right? So my conclusion is that for me it wouldn’t make sense to switch.

# Example Written Comment

My name is \_\_\_ and I live in \_\_\_. I oppose SDGE’s hydrogen blending project because it puts our health and safety at risk, passes unnecessary costs onto ratepayers, and delays the transition to clean electric buildings. I urge the CPUC to cancel this project and support proven solutions like electrification, rooftop solar, and storage. Thank you.

**2.** **For greater impact** **Speak In-Person at the Public Hearing**

* **Date:** Friday, September 26, 2025  
* **Times:** 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm  
* [RSVP HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZgZXJsXIVxsAKGee5bD7QLPvrJSWVO9jGPubRVJ6tDTv4HA/viewform?usp=header)
* **Location:** United Way of San Diego, County Conference Room 100A, 4699 Murphy Canyon Rd, San Diego, CA 92123

Sign up at the Public Advisor’s table when you arrive. Remarks are limited to 1 minute.

# Why This Project Is Wrong for San Diego

* **Minimal climate benefit:** Experts agree hydrogen blending does little to cut emissions.
* **Higher risks:** Hydrogen is more explosive than natural gas, leaks more easily, and produces more lung-damaging NOx. The American Medical Association formally opposes hydrogen blending in homes and buildings.  
* **Ratepayer burden:** SDGE is asking the CPUC to charge us $21 million for an experiment that benefits their bottom line, not the public.  
* **Better alternatives exist:** Local rooftop solar, battery storage, and full electrification are safer, cheaper, and available now.  

Even without hydrogen, gas appliances already pollute our homes. Studies from Stanford and Harvard link gas stoves to asthma, cancer risks, and benzene exposure equivalent to secondhand smoke. Blending hydrogen only makes things worse.

This is a **dangerous, expensive, and unnecessary project.** San Diego should not be a test site for risky fossil fuel experiments.

# Talking Points for Comments

* I oppose SDGE’s hydrogen blending demonstration project.  
* We need to transition off gas — not prolong it with dangerous hydrogen experiments.  
* The American Medical Association opposes hydrogen blending due to explosion risks and harmful NOx emissions.  
* San Diego should invest in electrification, rooftop solar, and storage instead.  
* This project is a cash grab — San Diegans should not be forced to pay $21 million to boost SDGE’s monopoly profits.
* These hearings prove why we need **Public Power**: an energy system that puts people and the planet before profit.

**Thank you for speaking up. Together, we can protect San Diego from SDGE’s profiteering and push for a truly clean, people-powered energy future.**",32,SanDiego

1nnu01k,"Looking to Borrow a Compatible Ryzen CPU (for BIOS update) – Long Shot, But Worth Asking",5,1758564692.0,"Hey all,

I’ve run into a snag with my build and figured I’d throw this out there to see if anyone local might be able to help.

I’ve got an ASUS TUF Gaming X570-Plus WiFi motherboard and a Ryzen 7 5800X CPU. Problem is, the board doesn’t have BIOS FlashBack, and my BIOS is too old to recognize the 5800X — so the system powers on, but won’t POST.

To update the BIOS, I need a compatible CPU that will actually boot on this board. That means anything from the Ryzen 3000 series (e.g., 3600, 3700X, etc.) should work. I don’t need to keep it, I’d just like to borrow it long enough to flash the BIOS.

I know it’s a long shot, but if anyone nearby has a spare chip that works with X570 they’d be willing to lend or let me test with, I’d really appreciate it. Happy to provide collateral, meet in public, or work out whatever makes you comfortable.

Thanks in advance!",13,SanDiego

They used to live among the kelp forests that we've all but destroyed... along with the abalone (snails) that got plundered and all but wiped out.

It's important that we try to work to restore these things... tourists come here and admire what we have naturally and want to try to exploit it like they have where they've come from and destroyed everything.. now they want to move here and do the same not realizing how much more there used to be and what we have is a fraction of what it was like here.

1nmorns,Shipping Motorcycle from Hawaii to California after frame swap,0,1758451481.0,"Hello,

I’m in kind of a tricky situation and wanted some advice.

- I’m a college student in California, but my bike (2025 Yamaha R7) is still in Hawaii.

- The OEM frame got swapped out for an aftermarket reinforced steel frame. The new frame has a legit VIN and MCO.

- Pasha (the shipper) says they need active registration or temporary registration, which I assume is a California temporary operating permit, one-trip permit. I don’t believe that Hawaii offers temporary registration.

Pasha: “To ship a vehicle from Hawaii, we will need a current registration. That registration does not have to be from Hawaii, and we can accept temporary registration as long as it is valid at the time of shipment.”

- Ideally, I’d rather just ship the bike as-is with the new VIN + MCO, then do the full registration in California. I do NOT want to deal with the whole safety and reregistering in Hawaii, just to have to redo it in California 😭

My questions:
 1.	Has anyone shipped a motorcycle with only an MCO (no active registration)?
 2.	Does California DMV allow you to register a bike with a new frame VIN/MCO straight from out-of-state?
 3.	Is there a way to bypass having to re-register in Hawaii?
 4. What does Pasha mean by “temporary registration?” Will Pasha allow a temp operating permit/one-trip permit?

Thanks.

ABC acquiesced to that pressure from affiliate networks Nextstar and Sinclair by removing Kimmel’s show indefinitely. This is direct action from the FCC, federal government, and Prez to suppress free speech, in direct violation with the first amendment. Be clear; The Director of the FCC knew what he was saying—he is a skilled government tactician who wrote the FCC chapter of Project 2025 (starts on p845, if you're looking for a good time). 

**Taking action:** This crap seems hopeless sometimes, but the affiliate networks have one huge vulnerability: they cannot survive without advertisers. So, to take action, your best bet is to applying pressure to advertisers who support the affiliate stations. In San Diego, **KSWB FOX 5 and KUSI** are [owned by Nextstar](https://www.nexstar.tv/stations/). There are no Sinclair stations in San Diego. 

**A quick call, email, google review, yelp review, or other message works:**

Your ad dollars are going to a station owned by Nexstar, the network that is suppressing free speech.

As a mod here I can't tell you about how difficult it is, to have a parent or grandparent be lost and the delay cause by the families NOT having all their info available and ready for a search.  Then to find out that the delay resulted in that missing persons passing.

1nlq9nr,Downtown San Diego isnt for you,780,1758347639.0,"a rant

just say that. why all the hating? 

I see these posts about downtown, and the majority of it is from people who lived here a decade to go or who only visit for games and events and have the most to say as if where they live is perfect

I've seen more Padres fans and drunk people from bars pissing on the streets than I ever have from a homeless person. Y'all come down here and piss everywhere and trash the place litter like unbelievably, and then get on the Internet and talk about how terrible it is to be here

Is there a lot of homeless people? Yeah 
Do they bother people the way Reddit likes to say they do? No 

I watch the local news and in the last three years I've not seen one story about a homeless person attacking anybody it's always somebody who's drunk and fighting or something similar. Not saying it doesn't happen, but it's not happening at the rate everybody likes to believe it is

I live here and I am walking my dogs about three hours a day throughout the day and evening in total I am on foot around my neighborhood all day long I see and hear most everything and it is nowhere near as dramatic as people make it.

I've seen more women harassed by men at the bars or on the street corners waiting for Ubers or whatever than I ever have from a homeless person 

But somebody will take one story from 20 years ago and run with it until the end of time   

Y'all really act as if Hillcreast is any safer. Hillcreast is crawling with meth addicts

downtown living is a lifestyle. If you're not built for it, just say so. Stay up in your boring suburbs where you have to drive every single place you go spending a lot of money in gas and parking and everything else.

There's plenty of advantages of living in downtown San Diego.  

*Still 15 minutes from numerous beaches. 

*Can go to all the Padres games and events and whatever and never worry about parking

*The only place you need to drive to is the dispensary, which can be delivered 

*if you are a drinker you can party until your heart's content and not to worry about an expensive Uber, late night train ride or driving Drunk to get home

i'm not here to convince anybody to live in downtown but I am getting annoyed at the rhetoric about how unsafe and how unclean it is when I see with with my own two eyes every day the safety and the clean issues not coming from the homeless be coming from people who visit here for events and then trash it and then leave 

Downtown San Diego is not meant to be like other downtowns in most cities. It's San Diego. Nobody is moving here to be in downtown. People move to San Diego for the beach and the weather and things like that which can be had from most neighborhoods around the county

I was here as a kid, but ended up moving and grew up in New York City and I lived in Los Angeles for over a decade so I've been to many downtown areas and this one? Is a fucking daycare comparatively speaking. If you can't handle downtown San Diego if it's so scary and so sketchy then you probably should never visit another downtown and any other major city on a coast

also everyone acts like downtown is strictly gaslamp and East Village. There is Little Italy, Cortez Hill, Balboa, Marina District, bankers hill etc those neighborhoods are ALL downtown san diego. 

if you don't like it so much or if it's so bad just stay your ass home. Stop going to the Padres games when that happens maybe they'll clean it up more to your liking 

and no I have nothing better to do right now than to give you a word salad rant about people's shitty takes on downtown ",468,SanDiego

1nli6e1,Dermatologist in SD that can help me with a scar,10,1758322902.0,"I am scarred (literally and figuratively) from a dermatologist in El Cajon that sliced off a mole of mine without asking. This was about a year ago and i don’t even think he’s practicing anymore. If he was I would beg him to stop. But I won’t go into the dirty details of this awful appointment besides the fact that his “biopsy” i.e. slicing off a mole of mine and then never even calling me to tell me the results of said biopsy left its mark on me. He did not tell me that the biopsy meant cutting it off btw. I assumed it was scraping a few cells or something. A little communication would have gone a long way. 

Do doctors get paid per mole removal? He tried to convince me to cut off a bunch of them—none cancerous btw. I literally was only there to get screened for skin cancer. Now I have this raised puffy scar on my shoulder where he removed my mole. I thought it would heal flat but it looks like someone put a cigarette out on me. It’s big and pinkish purple. I actually cry about it sometimes because it just used to be a cute flat mole and now it’s a lump of unsightly scar tissue. I haven’t dealt with it because I’m worried about just getting another shitty dermatologist trigger happy with a scalpel. But it makes me actively upset because it’s very obvious (I live in tank tops). 

Does anyone know a dermatologist that specializes in scar stuff? Ideally getting it to flatten out or something? I can’t even tattoo over this to disguise it. I’ve considered going full gen z and putting those pimple patches on it just to not have to look at it but it’s too damn big. I have sharp health care, ideally somewhere that will that that. Reaching out in a moment of desperation because I’m so mad at myself for letting this freaky old man cut off a part of my body for nothing. Need a happier ending.

In 2021 I moved to Miami (Brickell) and I remember the first thing that stood out to me was how clean and active it was compared to DTSD. At any given time of day the streets are bustling - people walking dogs, exercising, going out to eat, or to work. Brickell completely revived downtown Miami over the past few years with just the right mix of jobs, people, restaurants, and even a shopping mall that's always packed

Now when I visit downtown San Diego it feels like a ghost town. There's no one out during the day south of Broadway because there's no jobs. There's no shopping (we know about Horton Plaza) and it just feels like there's no reason to be in downtown unless you party - at night the streets come alive. 

I know SD has more neighborhoods to offer than just DT, more than other major cities, but what's crazy is that the condos in DT hold their value and it keeps getting prohibitively more expensive. Yet the people that live here don't go out in the day. 

After experiencing other downtowns more its weird to me. I hope the Horton Plaza office project gets picked back up and can revitalize DT with young professionals to bring more life to it during the day.",218,SanDiego

This exists in other places. They exist in Denver, Houston, Germany, UK, etc. I’m sure elsewhere in the US. I don’t want a Dave & Busters. Usually called. Biergarten, Bierhaus, beer garden. A food hall.

The new Olive Street Park sort of has this being next to Communal Coffee. Izola downtown off Faultline Park downtown almost does. Station Tavern in South Park is decent. Stone at Liberty Station sort of meets the mark but every time I’ve gone the vibe seems more like business meeting or weekend brunch than family hangout.

1nkt7bs,SD Humane Society Employs Pro Do Euthanasia Enthusiast as Assistant Director of Animal Shelter,0,1758253539.0,"I apologize for my mistake about the SD Humane Society and have corrected it in this edited post but do not know how to change the title. Any help in that area would be appreciated.

I was appalled to learn that the assistant director of Animal control, who works for the San Diego County Department of Animal Services has been promoting mass euthanasia of dogs, raising the rate of killings skyward and believes even more killings should occur. Her name is Rachael Borelli and employing her means the SD County Department  of Animal Services is advocating that more and more dogs should be killed. 

One woman reported she had to return a dog because her other dog wouldn't accept him. She reported he was a great dog and was assured he would not be euthanized. Rachael Borelli signed his euthanasia forms and had him killed soon after the woman left the building. The next day, she decided she would try to find another way to keep the dog and came back for him, but of course, he had already been killed.

A kind soul on reddit explained my mistake in believing that this Department, like other SD Animal Control Departments, was directly controlled by the SD Humane Society. I humbly Apologize for my mistake. The kind Reddit person instead thoughtfully directed me to the SDCounty Department of Animal Services. I have been unable to find any way to complain to them directly but have sent a query to their general contact email: dasinfo@sdcounty.ca.gov

If anyone knows a better contact info, I would appreciate the information.

Knowing this, it is difficult to understand how the County of San Diego, who asks for public donations on their Animal Services webpage,  could be so inhumane as to allow this terrible woman to even work for Animal Control, let alone employ her as the assistant director of Animal Control, which in her eyes means Animal Murder. One of her workers was so fed up she became a whistle blower,  releasing a voicemail where Borelli was swearing and advocating for even more dog deaths. Two other employess who left their jobs said that they were not surprised by the viocemail message.

Fortunately, this was reported on KPBS. I hope anyone who reads this will join me in complaining. If enough of us care, and take just 5 minutes to email a complaint, we can make a difference and save dog lives. It is a free and takes just a small amount of time

I am a Journalism student at San Diego State University and I am writing an article for a class about the unemployment rate in San Diego and what it looks like. I'm looking to speak to people who are either currently unemployed or those who were unemployed and what their struggles were. I'm looking to have a short conversation about what are/were your struggles on looking for jobs, your personal experience on looking at hiring applications, what hiring managers told you if you were turned down on a job offer, your view on the job market in San Diego, etc. The questions may change over time, but just to give you an idea, those are some questions that are related to what I'm talking about.

Disclaimer, my story will NOT be public. It will not be published by some news organization. It will be published on my personal blog that I created in my Digital Journalism class, therefore no one will see it except for those who have the link to my blog. I hoping to speak to at least 2 people who are comfortable to share their experience on being unemployed or who were unemployed and talk about their view on San Diego's job market and the unemployment rate. My story is due on October 27 so I would need to speak with a few people before that date. If you are willing to talk with me, please message me privately here on Reddit. If you know anyone else who's willing to share their thoughts, refer them to me or comment below.

I need to sell two cars. One is a 2015Fiat 500e and the other is a 2001 BMW Z3 Roadster. Both in great shape. Here are my questions for those that might have more knowledge about the process.

1) How do I ensure I don't get scammed? Have we gotten to a point where the only options are cash or drawing a cashier's check in person? I'm assuming none of the electronic payment methods are safe due to the possibility of hacked accounts and stolen credit cards.

2) I plan to use a Bill of Sale stating the sale is ""as is"" and final. I will also fill out the pink slip and file the necessary NRL on the DMV website. But this is where it gets weird. The NRL is supposed to document that I I have sold the car and are no longer liable. However, the DMV website says that it will still be in my name until the buyer registers it. I've heard horror stories about the buyer never registering it and the seller getting tickets (and worse) months later.

There’s a letter circulating around within employees… this move is costing more than what it would have cost to simply extend the leases. I’m debating whether or not to send the letter to all of the news sources and make this public. The City has failed its employees once again. ",6,SanDiego

They have little to NO emissions equipment. Too often belching over-rich mixtures from a.lack of maintenance or equipment. Sitting behind these vehicles in traffic makes your eyes burn and can give you a head ache. They NEVER get pulled over (for emissions). I had a chance once to speak off the record with a career CA Highway Patrol Officer (remember haters this is just one guy...) and asked about this issue. He told me if he pulls me over and issues a citation, there is a good chance I will show up on the court date and either pay the fine, fix the car or both.

Long Version:
I get together with a few friends from Clairemont and Poway area about once a month to eat and talk. We found one restaurant where you order at the counter and then seat yourself on a large patio. Because there are no servers, it doesn't feel wrong to stay at the table and talk for a long time. We tip the employees at the counter up front and there is always plenty of space around us for customers coming and going. If you know any restaurants like this in San Diego county, preferably near or between Clairemont and Poway, I would love to know about them! It would be nice to not always go to the same spot.

1ni07zj,Dear Starbucks Employee: Thanks For Taking Care of My Mom,326,1757975290.0,"I've had a long day. Month. Year.

My mom drove 100+ miles from up north to take me to a VA Appointment. Long story short. A lot of sleep issues and a broken rib.

After the appointment I asked her to take me to Target (Sports Arena) so I could pick up a med in the pharmacy. My mom was quite excited to go to Target after she found out it had a Starbucks inside (I guess she hadn't had her fix yet). After I was done at the pharmacy I went to the Starbucks to catch up with her. This is when I learned that she left her wallet somewhere (perhaps in the car, back home, my home). Anyway, you told her not to her worry about it and that you would take care it.

I heard about other apartments in San Diego having a mold issues so I'm wondering---

Apartment is Eaves in Rancho Penasquitos, San Diego 

She just moved into a new apartment and when she moved in everything seemed fine until she turned on the bathroom vent and left it on for a few hours. She came back to a HUGE amount of debris and dust shooting out of the vent and it sprinkled all over her bathroom.

It's been 2 weeks and now she has been having a constant cough and sore throat, but only when's in her apartment.

Maintenance came in and ""cleaned"" the bathroom vent. Every morning she wakes up with a really sore throat and cough, so she had maintenence check her bedroom HVAC. They said it was just from having the air pointed at her, but since then, no changes and the sore throat and cough is still the same.

She tried leaving the window open and and a humidifier, but the cough and sore throat is STILL bad and only when she runs the HVAC fan or AC. When she leaves the apartment, the sore throat starts going away. 

She put another maintenance request in to check the vents so this is now the 3rd time since she moved in 2 weeks.
I advised having an inspection for mold and possibly seeing a doctor. 

Any legal advice, or medical advice for her?",1,SanDiego

The main ongoing series didn’t quite capture certain landmarks, but comics artist and writer Adam Warren really went above and beyond with a few of his mini-series featuring the characters.

Focusing on the characters Grunge (it was the 90’s!) and Roxy “Freefall” Spaulding, his works utilized his anime-stylings in a few familiar settings.

I remember being shocked when the first issue of the Gen 13 Bootleg Series’ “Grunge The Movie” storyline, had the characters seeing a Hong Kong Film Festival at what appears to be the Mission Valley 20, let alone he captures the nuances of the mall during that time.

Shortly afterwards, Warren’s three-issue “Magical Drama Queen Roxy” showcased a few other familiar locales, such as the Hard Rock Cafe that was located down by the La Jolla Shores, let alone a visit Roxy makes to “The Mall of Doom,” borrows some imagery from ol’ Horton Plaza.  Also of note, the characters go into what appears to be tue Sam Goody at Horton too. I remember, because the one entrance had people stepping down a few steps into the main lower-level area!

Edit: WOW did people wildly understand this post. 1. I’m totally cool with horses on the beach and horses in general. 2. This wasn’t a local or a jockey taking their horses to the beach. This was a bunch of rednecks that parked their horse trailer at the beach so they could get a photo shoot, looked like they were from Arizona. 3. It’s a fucking off leash dog beach and they walked the horses directly into the crowd of dogs causing trouble. 4. There’s THOUSANDS of miles of accessible beach and they chose this one, just not a smart choice in my opinion.

My grandma had a masters in cultural music and would play classics on the piano like yankee doodle. Grandpa played the harmonica and had a small wooden man which he would hold over a board and thumb the board to make it ""dance"" to the music. It was a big stop for kids and field trips (i once rode along with a local school and got to see them perform).

I'm just hoping that in the 30 years of them doing this, and all the times people had cameras out for their performance, someone out there might have a recording i could have to show my dad, wife, and kids.

   * General = 3 VA/ft² × 810 = 2,430 VA
   * SABCs = 3 × 1,500 = 4,500 VA
   * Laundry = 1 × 1,500 = 1,500 VA
   * Range (Table 220.55, 1 range) = 8,000 VA (will verify nameplate)
   * Radiant ceiling heat (two zones): • If using measured totals: 3,400 + 2,400 = **5,800 VA** • If using circuit max: 2 × (20 A × 208 V) = **8,320 VA**
* → **Totals before demand** • With 5,800 VA heat: **22,230 VA** • With 8,320 VA heat: **24,750 VA**→ **Demand per 220.83(A): 8,000 + 40% of remainder** • 22,230 VA → **13,692 VA ≈ 65.9 A @ 208 V** • 24,750 VA → **14,700 VA ≈ 70.7 A @ 208 V**
* (For context only) 220.82 Optional ≈ 100–105 A here, but that method requires ≥100 A feeders, so I’m not using it to justify the existing 90 A.

**My Questions:**

1. What’s a realistic cost/effort in San Diego for a **retroactive permit** on a condo subpanel?
2. For a 90 A feeder, will DSD/inspection accept a **220.83(A)** calc at \~66–71 A (depending on heat nameplate), or push for a service/feeder upgrade?
3. Any gotchas with #2 AL feeders at \~200 ft (voltage-drop expectations for a typical condo load)?
4. Recommendations for local electricians familiar with **multi-family** and **retro permits** who can shepherd this through?
5. I’m planning an EVSE later, would it be better to permit panel now and EVSE later, or combine them?

I know DIY + unpermitted isn’t ideal, but the Zinsco was a legitimate fire hazard. Looking for practical advice on making this right with the city. Thanks in advance for any insights from those familiar with San Diego multi-family requirements.",1,SanDiego

Teachers’ unions and civil rights groups warn that the legislation, which is purported to combat antisemitism, will stifle criticisms of Israel and its genocidal assault on Gaza.

AB 715 was introduced by Assembly members Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Hollywood) and Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay). The legislation would require lawmakers to appoint an “Antisemitism Coordinator” for the state. That coordinator would be able to review the curriculum, and threaten schools with fines and dismissals for refusing to remove material deemed “factually inaccurate.”

It would allow Israel supporters to file unsupported complaints of antisemitism with the California Department of Education.

The bill was recently passed in both chambers, but the process was fast-tracked, as there were only three days left in the legislative session. Multiple lawmakers said they weren’t given adequate time to assess it.",53,SanDiego

1nqpl2f,San Diego Airport Valet is killing my EV battery with unauthorized driving,0,1758853218.0,"This is a warning to every EV driver thinking about leaving your car at San Diego International Airport’s Terminal 1 valet.

I left my Rivian R1S in valet 7 days ago. My GPS logs show the car has been driven multiple times without my authorization. Today, the battery is at 9% (I dropped it off at over 30%) and I haven’t even returned yet. By the time I get back Monday, it will likely be fully dead.

I’ve emailed and called the valet and the airport authority repeatedly. No one has responded. No explanation. No accountability. Just silence while they continue to run down my vehicle.

This isn’t “normal vampire drain.” This is unauthorized use. Twenty-one percent of my battery has been drained in a week, and my logs prove the car has been moved multiple times. That is theft of energy and unauthorized operation of my vehicle.

If you own an EV, do not trust San Diego Airport valet. You’re safer driving 90 minutes north and flying out of John Wayne/OC, because at least your vehicle won’t be abused while you’re away.

San Diego Airport: you owe every EV driver an explanation. You owe me an explanation. Stop ignoring calls and start addressing why your valet is treating customer vehicles like personal toys.
