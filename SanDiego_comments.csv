1nqlhqi,ng7yc91,"I worked seasonal at Target back in the day, one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had. People let their children shit diaperless as they crawl across folded clothing displays. People doing the fent lean before it was cool in the baby world section. Someone brandished a gun at me when I worked fitting rooms because I told him we didn’t have men’s snow gloves in stock. I witnessed a physical altercation between two moms at 4:30am over their position in line for a Hatchimals release, and my manager had to call the city because our biohazard cleanup kit couldn’t soak up all of the blood. Don’t even get me started on the way customers talk to employees, and you’ll be in the worst position as a seasonal associate. It was truly and without a doubt the most desolate I’ve ever felt about humanity.

1.) First wave - Grey cans delivered, black cans taken away.  You will receive an e-mail saying which day they will come by and 'haul away' and 'deliver new'.  If you currently have 2 black cans and elected for only 1 grey can, they will pickup the 2 black and leave you your (new) grey one.  Whatever you currently have, you will leave out for pick up.  Whatever new selections you made, will be delivered to you that same day.

2.) Second Wave - Blue cans delivered, old blue cans taken away.  You will receive a (separate) e-mail saying which day they will come by and 'haul away' and 'deliver new'.  Same as the black cans, all the current blue cans you have will need to be left out for pickup, and you will be delivered the number and size of blue cans you ordered.  When the policy changes to pick up blues every week - proposed to start July 2027 (currently every other week), you will have a chance to go into the portal and change your selection of blue cans (size and/or quantity).  You technically have the ability 'yearly' to change your can quantity and size mix.  Mid 2027 will be a popular time to do this with the change over to weekly blues.

3.) Third Wave - Green cans.  Green cans are NOT currently on the 'replacement' list like the greys and blues are (many of the green cans are already the 'chipped' variety, but not all of course).  There will be another e-mail announcing the green can status.  If you currently have two greens, you can keep setting out two greens and will get charged for 2 greens.  If you have two and said you only need one, you will surrender a green can at the appropriate time.  It doesn't sound like they have worked out all the details on, say, if one of your green cans is very broken and you need a replacement to keep your correct total.

1. Dump a mixture of equal parts sugar, baking soda, and borax around any area I've seen roaches or suspect they could come from. This concoction helps kill many of the roaches in your wall - the sugar entices them to eat it and bring some back to the colony, the baking soda dehydrates them and helps kill the individual roach, and the borax is a poison that kills many other roaches once they eat the dead roach's body (yes they are disgusting like that).

2. After a few days clean up the powder mixture and get some 4$ silicone caulk from Home Depot and seal up all of the little gaps between the bottom of the walls and the vinyl flooring. After sealing everything up I poured a little bit of the mixture again for good measure 

After seeing dozens of roaches in the first few days I moved in I've now only seen at most one or two small ones a month that are easy to deal with. Going to the landlord is also a good idea, but there's no way to guarantee they're actually taking proper action.",3,1758811868.0

- rotate between the three control kits to start to see which baits are effective, and then buy just the advion, alpine, or Max force bait to rotate regularly. you'll want to rotate the baits every month or two unless you notice the bait is ineffective.
-remember, just because you don't see roaches doesn't mean you don't have them, so those sticky glue boards are a good way to get a population sample.
- if you're hitting a wall with all three, try vendetta; I had the roaches knocked down for about 2 years and suddenly they weren't responding to the three baits, and the vendetta did the trick.
- I found the control kits gave way too much gentrol, so chances are you'll have plenty. they upset the reproductive cycle and are a good supplement to the bait.
- use a spray for large voids you can't get into or seal easily (think behind to kick under the kitchen) along with any doors, windows, or way into the home. I didn't have anywhere to keep a big spray jug so I just used the premixed temprid in a can.
- seal up all gaps and openings. look for cutouts under sinks, outlet plates, light switch plates, etc. make sure weather stripping and window seals are in good condition.
- keep a clean place. secure all food stuffs, wipe up all spills, clean the kitchen regularly. clean out books and crannies religiously. for best case wipe down all wet surfaces so there's no water left, but this is a hard one to keep up on.

First, you should contact the leasing office like everyone else said to have your apartment sprayed. Next you need to have MULTIPLE pesticide in your apartment in warm areas or places they are seen such as under the fridge. The reason is because if you have one pesticide, the roaches will outcompete the poison, so you need more than one. I can explain why I chose each one below:

1-Borat (suffocates them and makes their dead body poisonous) 
2-Gentrol (this makes the roaches not able to breed) 
3-Advion (a slow poison that allows roach to spread to other roaches in the colony) 


Combining these pesticides will help eradicate the colony. However it will take a few months so be patient! If the problem is not going away after two months, rotate the poison to another brand that has a different ingredient. If it still persists then the poison is not at the right place or the infestation is far too gone meaning you need to burn the whole place.",1,1758835090.0

Here are the best products, but they’re harsh. Use caution around pets, ideally drop everything at once like a bomb and leave for 24 hours just to let the smell dissipate.
1) diatomaceous earth around all entrances, exits, and windows. Idk if piling it up like a long ritualistic line of coke is the best way, but it worked for me. Bonus was that it kept ants out too.
2) advion cockroach bait gel syringes. Fill EVERY hole, every crevice, everything. Around electrical outlets, between your bathroom mirror and the wall, between baseboards that are lifting? Etc. This stuff works wonders but is only as good as the location you put it in. Keep this stuff on hand for when you see them taking new routes in/out.
3) Orthene roach killer powder. I sprinkle this into every corner, behind my stove, down every drain, pretty much anywhere I feel like. Do this double-masked with an alcohol pad between them because (I’m sure it’s bad for you, but mostly because) it smells like a cabbage fart on ‘roids. Your eyes will water and you will instinctively cough without even having smelled the smell. This is the step in which I make sure I’m gone for at least 12 hours afterward so that the cabbage fart can dissipate.

However, having said that.... you aren't going to get rid of them UNTIL YOU GET RID OF THEIR HOME BASE it's just that simple. 

These are German roaches and those tend to not be coming up via the drains.. but are in the walls of the unit.  If you just moved in, then the last tenant was responsible and the landlords sprayed as part of their clean up.

1npy5fb,ng75qb8,"The issue is that once schools close it’s going to be a lot harder to open them back up. There would also be a lot of public school teachers that would lose their jobs. 

Then there is the question of where the students are leaving to. According to the Voice of San Diego, a majority of them are simply moving away (probably due to affordability), but the second biggest group is leaving to online charter schools. 

Charter schools aren’t necessarily bad, but these online charter schools are incredibly lax in their grading. Almost anyone can pass these classes and it’s a very easy way to get a GED. Basically what it’s doing is making the GED meaningless. If for whatever reason colleges start getting stricter or something else happens that pressures families to return to in person classes, we are going to be in a lot of trouble. 

My concern is that if these schools close, we are going to experience a brain drain of qualified teachers and are going to be screwed if those online students return to in person classes in the future. We can’t just hire those teachers back. They are going to retire or move away somewhere where they can find work (assuming they even stay in the teaching profession). 

Finally, if these schools close, it’s probably going to be harder to continue offering programs like AP, IB, and other extracurricular activities in the schools that do remain.

1npuz30,ng2qsl5,"When you show up for jury duty, you'll go to the jury lounge with all other prospective jurors for the day. Whenever the jury lounge staff get the word that a case is going to trial and ready for jury selection, a number of prospective jurors will be randomly selected by lottery and told to report to a particular courtroom. They call for more jurors than they actually need, and everyone called up will go through a questioning process to determine who gets seated for the trial.

Those who don't get selected to report to a courtroom will continue waiting in the jury lounge. More lotteries will happen if there are more trials that need jurors. Once the jury lounge staff get word that no more jurors are needed for the day, everyone remaining will be sent home and your jury service is done.

It's entirely possible that they don't have any trials to select for that day, or all scheduled cases avoid going to trial at the last minute. When this happens, everyone is dismissed.

You can definitely bring a handheld console with you and play it in the jury lounge, just keep the volume turned off or use headphones/earbuds. However, if you get called up to a courtroom, you **must** put all electronic devices away and make sure your phone is turned off or silent.

Once you're actually at the courthouse, they'll hand out free transit day passes to anyone who wants one. You can take one even if you're not selected to report to a courtroom. If you do get selected, I think they offer you a new pass every day you report.",3,1758776176.0
1npuz30,ng56m56,"Really depends on how many cases the courthouse has lined up that day; I'm not a lawyer so maybe I'm just unaware and naive,  but there's no way that I've found that allows you to check what the schedule is like in advance. 

I've been to summoned in San diego twice. 

The first time was a very busy day; nearly everyone that was summoned that day was called up for jury selection. I actually needed to go the next day too because jury selection for the case I would be potentially assigned to was dragging a lot longer than expected.  And once you're in the courtroom, even during jury selection,  you can't say anything. You can't read.  You can't play games on your phone. You can't sleep.  You're just sitting there silently paying attention. I didn't end up getting selected to serve in the jury,  but i was still there for 1.5 days sitting silently and listening.

The second time was a more typical experience; i just sat in the waiting room playing on my switch. They called some people into courtrooms, but they dismissed the vast majority of people,  includjbg me. a little before lunch.

General advice:
Take the trolley. Pack a book or play games on your phone/switch. Food options immediately adjacent to the courthouse kind of suck. The cafeteria in the courthouse sucks even worse. So bring a sandwich or something if you'd like.",3,1758814466.0

1ns5t28,ngl0vw6,"Well, shoot… There a whole lotta city folk in these here comments. 

For real though, I’m wondering how many of these commenters have ever owned a horse. Or maybe even met a horse??

I grew up on a ranch. Horses and dogs together tend to cause… chaos. Even if they get along. One is a prey animal. One is not. One likes to chase. One likes to run. One likes to bark and nip. One gets spooked easily. 

Throw that unpredictable mix into a space where the horses can’t run away, and there are dumb humans around- someone could easily get hurt. Horse, dog or human. 

And to people saying “don’t take your dog to a beach if it has bad recall”- I have a feeling you’re one of those assholes who lets their dog walk around in the city off leash loudly bragging about how well trained it is. This message is for you: Time to read up on biology. Yes, dogs are domesticated. They are not human. They do not use human logic, or reason. They do not assess danger the same way we do. Instinct can take over at any time, without warning. 

I have known too many dogs who got hit by a car, because some self important jackass kept them off leash. Then they saw a bunny. Or got startled. Or did something that, I dunno, dogs do? Then they run out in the road- because they don’t know what roads are- and get hit. And yes, these were very well trained dogs with great recall. But they’re still animals. 

So if you put two animals together in an atypical space: they are gonna behave like animals, and do animal things and cause animal problems. 

For the record- I’m a neurotic dog mom. I love my dogs. I call them my babies. But I do not fool myself into thinking they aren’t dogs.

Ive owned horses my whole life horses and dogs dont usually mix well unless the horse has canine training. Coyotes wolves and horses are mortal enemies. Ive watched my own horse stomp out a coyote but he wohld never harm a trained dog. So im torn on an opinion. If the horse was trained then the lack of training falls on the dog owners(most are morons and dont know shit) also have family in the veterinary field and so i know this to be true. But since its legally ok to do. Id say anyone who is against it would just be basing their opinion on how they feel about it. Bottom line is. If the dogs off leash and causes problems legally its the dogs fault. (Been to court over this) the horse is considdered under control and "" reined"" as long as it had a halter and lead and or reins with a human in contact. Not saying its a smart idea but i am saying i could walk my horse downnthe highway and there wouldnt be issues unless something external chose to get involved.

""Tired of San Diego dog beaches being out of control

Been living in San Diego for the better part of 45 years (I'm 63), and like the city, the dog beaches are getting out of control. In the past, we always avoided known rough areas such as dog beach in OB (based on recommendations from the Humane society). We have two Golden Retrievers, and we loved Fiesta Island, Del Mar, and Coronado dog beaches. But, within the past two years, our six year old Golden has been attacked multiple times. Six months ago, our pup was attacked twice on the same outing. First by a husky, then about 20 minutes later by two Rottweilers while on Fiesta Island. During both attacks, the owners weren't anywhere nearby, and it was everything we could do to calm our boy down and make sure he was uninjured on that trip.

Two weeks ago, the only dogs on the beach were our two dogs and a third male poodle - along with the poodles owners/family. We were at the beach for less than 3 minutes when the poodle aggressively and unprovoked attacked my boy and was pushing and holding him under water. I ran to help my pup while the owners of the poodle pretty much did nothing. Even though this all happened in less than 30 seconds I finally was able to pull the dogs apart at the expense of having my left ring finger bitten off (held on by part of a tendon and a tiny bit of skin). The owner had a bandage and helped me wrap the hand and dangling by a tendon finger in the bandage. My wife then had to load the two dogs back I to the car and rush me to the Veterans Hospital ER in La Jolla where they ended up cutting to remaining tendon and skin away, and due to the injury had to amputate half of my finger. While I was being treated, my wife rushed back to Fiesta Island to get important information such as has the dog been vaccinated for rabies and such. Of course, the family packed up and skedaddled out of the area before any information or police report could be written.

In each of these instances, the attacks were unprovoked, and our pup knows that to avoid conflicts, he should swim out into deeper water where most dogs won't follow.

They 100% have the best atmosphere and vibes or any of the vibes based restaurants. It’s not even close. When good recipes and cooking videos have made high quality home cooking more accessible than ever, going out to eat, especially on a date night or when friends are in town or even just like a monthly get together with friends, needs to deliver more than just food. There’s now two types of restaurants. There’s convenience and there’s destination. The Disneyland comparison is apt I think.  As if that’s an insult. Disneyland is immaculate. Their experience is immaculate. Their food is much higher quality than should be expected for the experience they offer. 

Consortium prices are elevated but not absurdly so. Pick any other bar in OB, PB, North Park. Drinks are not any pricier at a consortium place than any random neighborhood bar and are indisputably better quality. Food is slightly higher than any other random place but also still well above average. 

If I am going out on a date night or bringing friends into town and want good atmosphere and good food and don’t want to pay Michelin prices, it’s basically a Consortium restaurant, Trust, or Kingfisher. 

Mabel’s is my favorite restaurant in town, and they have great vibes but they’re pricier than any consortium place and the vibes aren’t as good. Food is world class and vibes are still great. Fort Oak is pricier and isn’t as much of an escape. Literally any other place downtown is either just as good, less of an escape, and costs just as much. Or you could go to UTC and hit Javier’s which is just as vibey but pricier. Or Din Tai Fung which is pricier. 

Or Juniper and Ivy which tastes better but is pricier and not as good of vibe.

I’m all here for criticisms of how they treat their employees. If that’s true. Fuck them. But from a dining experience, cost, and feeling of escape on a Friday night, there’s nowhere else that goes you as much bang for the buck.",6,1759013885.0

They don’t do call backs on the wait list so we would have basically had to wait at the bar or immediately outside to hear our name for a wait over an hour. There was no room at the bar either so we settled on something else… the Layfette across the street. I also know a person who goes every month to Red Fox with a group of friends. I don’t think they closed because of the Layfette. If they would offer a text back when a table is ready it would allow for patrons to grab a drink or walk around instead of standing around 🤷‍♀️,2,1759006906.0

These were hands-on, interactive shows designed specifically for elementary and middle school field trips, often tied to California’s state history curriculum.

Based off of what basketno4817 said about there being a “Music of the Old Town” program designed to go along with California state history curriculum, there may be a good chance that the educational program was mentioned in some episode about Old Town. At least some of the performers might have shown up in a clip.


There are like 2-3 shows on KPBS similar to *About San Diego.* Since they’re very local-run, you could maybe even reach out to some of the shows and get a reply. I can’t remember their names atm but I’ll come back to edit if I do.

1.  You can see how his formal education informs his art.  He has a sculptor's attention to anatomy that shines in large pieces, and a painter's eye for color mixing which shows in the backgrounds he wraps around central subjects to add depth and define space.


2.  I had one design session with him before actually going under the needle.  I felt like he listened respectfully to my vague ideas, and  made suggestions for how to turn those ideas into a finished piece that weren't just steam rolling over my opinion.  The whole process felt really interactive.


3.  The actual tattoo was done in one 6'ish hour appointment.  I'm a pretty quiet person.  6 hours of needle work doesn't phase me but 6 hours of conversation? Hell no.  So it was a huge plus that he was cool with me just chilling on the table and shifting around whenever he needed to reach more skin, and I was happy to let him put his mental focus into the work rather than listening to me talk about my job or relationships or whatever.  😆",2,1758996139.0

It's funny you mention Abrego Garcia, since that's [exactly what happened to him](https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-deportation-maryland-man-trump-error-818a0fa1218de714448edcb5be1f7347). Being ""not a very nice guy"" doesn't mean you get deported. Funny that at the end of your comment you even go so far as to refer to it as a ""grave injustice,"" yet you're still peddling that right wing bullshit.

>The media can’t find another example of any such grave injustice.

 There's actually a [whole Wikipedia article about the deportation and detainment of US citizens under Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_and_deportation_of_American_citizens_in_the_second_Trump_administration#Unidentified_4_and_7-year-old_siblings), but I'm sure that kind of information doesn't get posted in your echo chambers.

Here are some more articles about the grave injustices this admin keeps committing, if your reading isn't as stunted as your logic and empathy seem to be.

1nrombn,ngizedp,"It should be honored. And if it's not honored, there should be repercussions. (Just as there should be repercussions for the employers profiting off their illegal labor, etc.)

But we're a land of laws. Masked thugs shouldn't be able to snatch people off the street at their whims. And when people are detained, they should get legal representation, and their day in court. If they lose, then they get what the law allows, nothing more. They shouldn't be sent to a concentration camp, paid for with US taxpayer money. And they sure as shit shouldn't be flown to a foreign land they've never set foot in before, again, paid for by taxpayer money.

There needs to be oversight and transparency in the process. [An elderly business owner and citizen in LA was attacked by ICE recently. ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/los-angeles-car-wash-owner-ice-raid-lawsuit) He's suing for $50 Million.

Am I supposed to care that bad people were deported? There are rapist citizens too, like Trump who was found at fault for sexual assault in court. The problem is that deportations are occurring without due process, and that people are being snatched in the street. If someone is going to be deported, it isn't difficult to give them a trial and to show up at their home with a warrant.

Also, how the fuck are you going to claim that there were any other examples of such injustices, then gloss over the fact that US children with cancer were deported?
