1nqlhqi,ng7yc91,"I worked seasonal at Target back in the day, one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had. People let their children shit diaperless as they crawl across folded clothing displays. People doing the fent lean before it was cool in the baby world section. Someone brandished a gun at me when I worked fitting rooms because I told him we didn’t have men’s snow gloves in stock. I witnessed a physical altercation between two moms at 4:30am over their position in line for a Hatchimals release, and my manager had to call the city because our biohazard cleanup kit couldn’t soak up all of the blood. Don’t even get me started on the way customers talk to employees, and you’ll be in the worst position as a seasonal associate. It was truly and without a doubt the most desolate I’ve ever felt about humanity.

1.) First wave - Grey cans delivered, black cans taken away.  You will receive an e-mail saying which day they will come by and 'haul away' and 'deliver new'.  If you currently have 2 black cans and elected for only 1 grey can, they will pickup the 2 black and leave you your (new) grey one.  Whatever you currently have, you will leave out for pick up.  Whatever new selections you made, will be delivered to you that same day.

2.) Second Wave - Blue cans delivered, old blue cans taken away.  You will receive a (separate) e-mail saying which day they will come by and 'haul away' and 'deliver new'.  Same as the black cans, all the current blue cans you have will need to be left out for pickup, and you will be delivered the number and size of blue cans you ordered.  When the policy changes to pick up blues every week - proposed to start July 2027 (currently every other week), you will have a chance to go into the portal and change your selection of blue cans (size and/or quantity).  You technically have the ability 'yearly' to change your can quantity and size mix.  Mid 2027 will be a popular time to do this with the change over to weekly blues.

3.) Third Wave - Green cans.  Green cans are NOT currently on the 'replacement' list like the greys and blues are (many of the green cans are already the 'chipped' variety, but not all of course).  There will be another e-mail announcing the green can status.  If you currently have two greens, you can keep setting out two greens and will get charged for 2 greens.  If you have two and said you only need one, you will surrender a green can at the appropriate time.  It doesn't sound like they have worked out all the details on, say, if one of your green cans is very broken and you need a replacement to keep your correct total.

1. Dump a mixture of equal parts sugar, baking soda, and borax around any area I've seen roaches or suspect they could come from. This concoction helps kill many of the roaches in your wall - the sugar entices them to eat it and bring some back to the colony, the baking soda dehydrates them and helps kill the individual roach, and the borax is a poison that kills many other roaches once they eat the dead roach's body (yes they are disgusting like that).

2. After a few days clean up the powder mixture and get some 4$ silicone caulk from Home Depot and seal up all of the little gaps between the bottom of the walls and the vinyl flooring. After sealing everything up I poured a little bit of the mixture again for good measure 

After seeing dozens of roaches in the first few days I moved in I've now only seen at most one or two small ones a month that are easy to deal with. Going to the landlord is also a good idea, but there's no way to guarantee they're actually taking proper action.",3,1758811868.0

- rotate between the three control kits to start to see which baits are effective, and then buy just the advion, alpine, or Max force bait to rotate regularly. you'll want to rotate the baits every month or two unless you notice the bait is ineffective.
-remember, just because you don't see roaches doesn't mean you don't have them, so those sticky glue boards are a good way to get a population sample.
- if you're hitting a wall with all three, try vendetta; I had the roaches knocked down for about 2 years and suddenly they weren't responding to the three baits, and the vendetta did the trick.
- I found the control kits gave way too much gentrol, so chances are you'll have plenty. they upset the reproductive cycle and are a good supplement to the bait.
- use a spray for large voids you can't get into or seal easily (think behind to kick under the kitchen) along with any doors, windows, or way into the home. I didn't have anywhere to keep a big spray jug so I just used the premixed temprid in a can.
- seal up all gaps and openings. look for cutouts under sinks, outlet plates, light switch plates, etc. make sure weather stripping and window seals are in good condition.
- keep a clean place. secure all food stuffs, wipe up all spills, clean the kitchen regularly. clean out books and crannies religiously. for best case wipe down all wet surfaces so there's no water left, but this is a hard one to keep up on.

First, you should contact the leasing office like everyone else said to have your apartment sprayed. Next you need to have MULTIPLE pesticide in your apartment in warm areas or places they are seen such as under the fridge. The reason is because if you have one pesticide, the roaches will outcompete the poison, so you need more than one. I can explain why I chose each one below:

1-Borat (suffocates them and makes their dead body poisonous) 
2-Gentrol (this makes the roaches not able to breed) 
3-Advion (a slow poison that allows roach to spread to other roaches in the colony) 


Combining these pesticides will help eradicate the colony. However it will take a few months so be patient! If the problem is not going away after two months, rotate the poison to another brand that has a different ingredient. If it still persists then the poison is not at the right place or the infestation is far too gone meaning you need to burn the whole place.",1,1758835090.0

Here are the best products, but they’re harsh. Use caution around pets, ideally drop everything at once like a bomb and leave for 24 hours just to let the smell dissipate.
1) diatomaceous earth around all entrances, exits, and windows. Idk if piling it up like a long ritualistic line of coke is the best way, but it worked for me. Bonus was that it kept ants out too.
2) advion cockroach bait gel syringes. Fill EVERY hole, every crevice, everything. Around electrical outlets, between your bathroom mirror and the wall, between baseboards that are lifting? Etc. This stuff works wonders but is only as good as the location you put it in. Keep this stuff on hand for when you see them taking new routes in/out.
3) Orthene roach killer powder. I sprinkle this into every corner, behind my stove, down every drain, pretty much anywhere I feel like. Do this double-masked with an alcohol pad between them because (I’m sure it’s bad for you, but mostly because) it smells like a cabbage fart on ‘roids. Your eyes will water and you will instinctively cough without even having smelled the smell. This is the step in which I make sure I’m gone for at least 12 hours afterward so that the cabbage fart can dissipate.

These are German roaches and those tend to not be coming up via the drains.. but are in the walls of the unit.  If you just moved in, then the last tenant was responsible and the landlords sprayed as part of their clean up.

1npy5fb,ng75qb8,"The issue is that once schools close it’s going to be a lot harder to open them back up. There would also be a lot of public school teachers that would lose their jobs. 

Then there is the question of where the students are leaving to. According to the Voice of San Diego, a majority of them are simply moving away (probably due to affordability), but the second biggest group is leaving to online charter schools. 

Charter schools aren’t necessarily bad, but these online charter schools are incredibly lax in their grading. Almost anyone can pass these classes and it’s a very easy way to get a GED. Basically what it’s doing is making the GED meaningless. If for whatever reason colleges start getting stricter or something else happens that pressures families to return to in person classes, we are going to be in a lot of trouble. 

My concern is that if these schools close, we are going to experience a brain drain of qualified teachers and are going to be screwed if those online students return to in person classes in the future. We can’t just hire those teachers back. They are going to retire or move away somewhere where they can find work (assuming they even stay in the teaching profession). 

Finally, if these schools close, it’s probably going to be harder to continue offering programs like AP, IB, and other extracurricular activities in the schools that do remain.

1npuz30,ng2qsl5,"When you show up for jury duty, you'll go to the jury lounge with all other prospective jurors for the day. Whenever the jury lounge staff get the word that a case is going to trial and ready for jury selection, a number of prospective jurors will be randomly selected by lottery and told to report to a particular courtroom. They call for more jurors than they actually need, and everyone called up will go through a questioning process to determine who gets seated for the trial.

Those who don't get selected to report to a courtroom will continue waiting in the jury lounge. More lotteries will happen if there are more trials that need jurors. Once the jury lounge staff get word that no more jurors are needed for the day, everyone remaining will be sent home and your jury service is done.

It's entirely possible that they don't have any trials to select for that day, or all scheduled cases avoid going to trial at the last minute. When this happens, everyone is dismissed.

You can definitely bring a handheld console with you and play it in the jury lounge, just keep the volume turned off or use headphones/earbuds. However, if you get called up to a courtroom, you **must** put all electronic devices away and make sure your phone is turned off or silent.

Once you're actually at the courthouse, they'll hand out free transit day passes to anyone who wants one. You can take one even if you're not selected to report to a courtroom. If you do get selected, I think they offer you a new pass every day you report.",3,1758776176.0
1npuz30,ng56m56,"Really depends on how many cases the courthouse has lined up that day; I'm not a lawyer so maybe I'm just unaware and naive,  but there's no way that I've found that allows you to check what the schedule is like in advance. 

I've been to summoned in San diego twice. 

The first time was a very busy day; nearly everyone that was summoned that day was called up for jury selection. I actually needed to go the next day too because jury selection for the case I would be potentially assigned to was dragging a lot longer than expected.  And once you're in the courtroom, even during jury selection,  you can't say anything. You can't read.  You can't play games on your phone. You can't sleep.  You're just sitting there silently paying attention. I didn't end up getting selected to serve in the jury,  but i was still there for 1.5 days sitting silently and listening.

The second time was a more typical experience; i just sat in the waiting room playing on my switch. They called some people into courtrooms, but they dismissed the vast majority of people,  includjbg me. a little before lunch.

General advice:
Take the trolley. Pack a book or play games on your phone/switch. Food options immediately adjacent to the courthouse kind of suck. The cafeteria in the courthouse sucks even worse. So bring a sandwich or something if you'd like.",3,1758814466.0
