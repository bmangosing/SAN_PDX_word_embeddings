1nqlhqi,ng7yc91,"I worked seasonal at Target back in the day, one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had. People let their children shit diaperless as they crawl across folded clothing displays. People doing the fent lean before it was cool in the baby world section. Someone brandished a gun at me when I worked fitting rooms because I told him we didn’t have men’s snow gloves in stock. I witnessed a physical altercation between two moms at 4:30am over their position in line for a Hatchimals release, and my manager had to call the city because our biohazard cleanup kit couldn’t soak up all of the blood. Don’t even get me started on the way customers talk to employees, and you’ll be in the worst position as a seasonal associate. It was truly and without a doubt the most desolate I’ve ever felt about humanity.

1.) First wave - Grey cans delivered, black cans taken away.  You will receive an e-mail saying which day they will come by and 'haul away' and 'deliver new'.  If you currently have 2 black cans and elected for only 1 grey can, they will pickup the 2 black and leave you your (new) grey one.  Whatever you currently have, you will leave out for pick up.  Whatever new selections you made, will be delivered to you that same day.

2.) Second Wave - Blue cans delivered, old blue cans taken away.  You will receive a (separate) e-mail saying which day they will come by and 'haul away' and 'deliver new'.  Same as the black cans, all the current blue cans you have will need to be left out for pickup, and you will be delivered the number and size of blue cans you ordered.  When the policy changes to pick up blues every week - proposed to start July 2027 (currently every other week), you will have a chance to go into the portal and change your selection of blue cans (size and/or quantity).  You technically have the ability 'yearly' to change your can quantity and size mix.  Mid 2027 will be a popular time to do this with the change over to weekly blues.

3.) Third Wave - Green cans.  Green cans are NOT currently on the 'replacement' list like the greys and blues are (many of the green cans are already the 'chipped' variety, but not all of course).  There will be another e-mail announcing the green can status.  If you currently have two greens, you can keep setting out two greens and will get charged for 2 greens.  If you have two and said you only need one, you will surrender a green can at the appropriate time.  It doesn't sound like they have worked out all the details on, say, if one of your green cans is very broken and you need a replacement to keep your correct total.

1. Dump a mixture of equal parts sugar, baking soda, and borax around any area I've seen roaches or suspect they could come from. This concoction helps kill many of the roaches in your wall - the sugar entices them to eat it and bring some back to the colony, the baking soda dehydrates them and helps kill the individual roach, and the borax is a poison that kills many other roaches once they eat the dead roach's body (yes they are disgusting like that).

2. After a few days clean up the powder mixture and get some 4$ silicone caulk from Home Depot and seal up all of the little gaps between the bottom of the walls and the vinyl flooring. After sealing everything up I poured a little bit of the mixture again for good measure 

After seeing dozens of roaches in the first few days I moved in I've now only seen at most one or two small ones a month that are easy to deal with. Going to the landlord is also a good idea, but there's no way to guarantee they're actually taking proper action.",3,1758811868.0

- rotate between the three control kits to start to see which baits are effective, and then buy just the advion, alpine, or Max force bait to rotate regularly. you'll want to rotate the baits every month or two unless you notice the bait is ineffective.
-remember, just because you don't see roaches doesn't mean you don't have them, so those sticky glue boards are a good way to get a population sample.
- if you're hitting a wall with all three, try vendetta; I had the roaches knocked down for about 2 years and suddenly they weren't responding to the three baits, and the vendetta did the trick.
- I found the control kits gave way too much gentrol, so chances are you'll have plenty. they upset the reproductive cycle and are a good supplement to the bait.
- use a spray for large voids you can't get into or seal easily (think behind to kick under the kitchen) along with any doors, windows, or way into the home. I didn't have anywhere to keep a big spray jug so I just used the premixed temprid in a can.
- seal up all gaps and openings. look for cutouts under sinks, outlet plates, light switch plates, etc. make sure weather stripping and window seals are in good condition.
- keep a clean place. secure all food stuffs, wipe up all spills, clean the kitchen regularly. clean out books and crannies religiously. for best case wipe down all wet surfaces so there's no water left, but this is a hard one to keep up on.

First, you should contact the leasing office like everyone else said to have your apartment sprayed. Next you need to have MULTIPLE pesticide in your apartment in warm areas or places they are seen such as under the fridge. The reason is because if you have one pesticide, the roaches will outcompete the poison, so you need more than one. I can explain why I chose each one below:

1-Borat (suffocates them and makes their dead body poisonous) 
2-Gentrol (this makes the roaches not able to breed) 
3-Advion (a slow poison that allows roach to spread to other roaches in the colony) 


Combining these pesticides will help eradicate the colony. However it will take a few months so be patient! If the problem is not going away after two months, rotate the poison to another brand that has a different ingredient. If it still persists then the poison is not at the right place or the infestation is far too gone meaning you need to burn the whole place.",1,1758835090.0

1) diatomaceous earth around all entrances, exits, and windows. Idk if piling it up like a long ritualistic line of coke is the best way, but it worked for me. Bonus was that it kept ants out too.
2) advion cockroach bait gel syringes. Fill EVERY hole, every crevice, everything. Around electrical outlets, between your bathroom mirror and the wall, between baseboards that are lifting? Etc. This stuff works wonders but is only as good as the location you put it in. Keep this stuff on hand for when you see them taking new routes in/out.
3) Orthene roach killer powder. I sprinkle this into every corner, behind my stove, down every drain, pretty much anywhere I feel like. Do this double-masked with an alcohol pad between them because (I’m sure it’s bad for you, but mostly because) it smells like a cabbage fart on ‘roids. Your eyes will water and you will instinctively cough without even having smelled the smell. This is the step in which I make sure I’m gone for at least 12 hours afterward so that the cabbage fart can dissipate.

Scatter a mix of liquid, solid, and mechanical traps throughout your space.

Then there is the question of where the students are leaving to. According to the Voice of San Diego, a majority of them are simply moving away (probably due to affordability), but the second biggest group is leaving to online charter schools. 

Charter schools aren’t necessarily bad, but these online charter schools are incredibly lax in their grading. Almost anyone can pass these classes and it’s a very easy way to get a GED. Basically what it’s doing is making the GED meaningless. If for whatever reason colleges start getting stricter or something else happens that pressures families to return to in person classes, we are going to be in a lot of trouble. 

My concern is that if these schools close, we are going to experience a brain drain of qualified teachers and are going to be screwed if those online students return to in person classes in the future. We can’t just hire those teachers back. They are going to retire or move away somewhere where they can find work (assuming they even stay in the teaching profession). 

Finally, if these schools close, it’s probably going to be harder to continue offering programs like AP, IB, and other extracurricular activities in the schools that do remain. That would make San Diego school districts less attractive to families. That could lead to less students, so more closures, which means less students, and so on.",1,1758835022.0

1npuz30,ng2qsl5,"When you show up for jury duty, you'll go to the jury lounge with all other prospective jurors for the day. Whenever the jury lounge staff get the word that a case is going to trial and ready for jury selection, a number of prospective jurors will be randomly selected by lottery and told to report to a particular courtroom. They call for more jurors than they actually need, and everyone called up will go through a questioning process to determine who gets seated for the trial.

Those who don't get selected to report to a courtroom will continue waiting in the jury lounge. More lotteries will happen if there are more trials that need jurors. Once the jury lounge staff get word that no more jurors are needed for the day, everyone remaining will be sent home and your jury service is done.

It's entirely possible that they don't have any trials to select for that day, or all scheduled cases avoid going to trial at the last minute. When this happens, everyone is dismissed.

You can definitely bring a handheld console with you and play it in the jury lounge, just keep the volume turned off or use headphones/earbuds. However, if you get called up to a courtroom, you **must** put all electronic devices away and make sure your phone is turned off or silent.

Once you're actually at the courthouse, they'll hand out free transit day passes to anyone who wants one. You can take one even if you're not selected to report to a courtroom. If you do get selected, I think they offer you a new pass every day you report.",3,1758776176.0

I've been to summoned in San diego twice. 

The first time was a very busy day; nearly everyone that was summoned that day was called up for jury selection. I actually needed to go the next day too because jury selection for the case I would be potentially assigned to was dragging a lot longer than expected.  And once you're in the courtroom, even during jury selection,  you can't say anything. You can't read.  You can't play games on your phone. You can't sleep.  You're just sitting there silently paying attention. I didn't end up getting selected to serve in the jury,  but i was still there for 1.5 days sitting silently and listening.

The second time was a more typical experience; i just sat in the waiting room playing on my switch. They called some people into courtrooms, but they dismissed the vast majority of people,  includjbg me. a little before lunch.

General advice:
Take the trolley. Pack a book or play games on your phone/switch. Food options immediately adjacent to the courthouse kind of suck. The cafeteria in the courthouse sucks even worse. So bring a sandwich or something if you'd like.",3,1758814466.0

I grew up on a ranch. Horses and dogs together tend to cause… chaos. Even if they get along. One is a prey animal. One is not. One likes to chase. One likes to run. One likes to bark and nip. One gets spooked easily. 

Throw that unpredictable mix into a space where the horses can’t run away, and there are dumb humans around- someone could easily get hurt. Horse, dog or human. 

And to people saying “don’t take your dog to a beach if it has bad recall”- I have a feeling you’re one of those assholes who lets their dog walk around in the city off leash loudly bragging about how well trained it is. This message is for you: Time to read up on biology. Yes, dogs are domesticated. They are not human. They do not use human logic, or reason. They do not assess danger the same way we do. Instinct can take over at any time, without warning. 

I have known too many dogs who got hit by a car, because some self important jackass kept them off leash. Then they saw a bunny. Or got startled. Or did something that, I dunno, dogs do? Then they run out in the road- because they don’t know what roads are- and get hit. And yes, these were very well trained dogs with great recall. But they’re still animals. 

So if you put two animals together in an atypical space: they are gonna behave like animals, and do animal things and cause animal problems. 

For the record- I’m a neurotic dog mom. I love my dogs. I call them my babies. But I do not fool myself into thinking they aren’t dogs. 

Also, sorry for the swearing, one of said babies is really sick and I’m stressing out.",12,1759025872.0

It sounds like this was incident-free, but horses are large and can be dangerous. A dog could've been kicked, or someone, like a child. A kick **WILL** kill your dog, and it could kill an adult.

Ive owned horses my whole life horses and dogs dont usually mix well unless the horse has canine training. Coyotes wolves and horses are mortal enemies. Ive watched my own horse stomp out a coyote but he wohld never harm a trained dog. So im torn on an opinion. If the horse was trained then the lack of training falls on the dog owners(most are morons and dont know shit) also have family in the veterinary field and so i know this to be true. But since its legally ok to do. Id say anyone who is against it would just be basing their opinion on how they feel about it. Bottom line is. If the dogs off leash and causes problems legally its the dogs fault. (Been to court over this) the horse is considdered under control and "" reined"" as long as it had a halter and lead and or reins with a human in contact.

""Tired of San Diego dog beaches being out of control

Been living in San Diego for the better part of 45 years (I'm 63), and like the city, the dog beaches are getting out of control. In the past, we always avoided known rough areas such as dog beach in OB (based on recommendations from the Humane society). We have two Golden Retrievers, and we loved Fiesta Island, Del Mar, and Coronado dog beaches. But, within the past two years, our six year old Golden has been attacked multiple times. Six months ago, our pup was attacked twice on the same outing. First by a husky, then about 20 minutes later by two Rottweilers while on Fiesta Island. During both attacks, the owners weren't anywhere nearby, and it was everything we could do to calm our boy down and make sure he was uninjured on that trip.

Two weeks ago, the only dogs on the beach were our two dogs and a third male poodle - along with the poodles owners/family. We were at the beach for less than 3 minutes when the poodle aggressively and unprovoked attacked my boy and was pushing and holding him under water. I ran to help my pup while the owners of the poodle pretty much did nothing. Even though this all happened in less than 30 seconds I finally was able to pull the dogs apart at the expense of having my left ring finger bitten off (held on by part of a tendon and a tiny bit of skin). The owner had a bandage and helped me wrap the hand and dangling by a tendon finger in the bandage. My wife then had to load the two dogs back I to the car and rush me to the Veterans Hospital ER in La Jolla where they ended up cutting to remaining tendon and skin away, and due to the injury had to amputate half of my finger. While I was being treated, my wife rushed back to Fiesta Island to get important information such as has the dog been vaccinated for rabies and such.

""Tired of San Diego dog beaches being out of control

Been living in San Diego for the better part of 45 years (I'm 63), and like the city, the dog beaches are getting out of control. In the past, we always avoided known rough areas such as dog beach in OB (based on recommendations from the Humane society). We have two Golden Retrievers, and we loved Fiesta Island, Del Mar, and Coronado dog beaches. But, within the past two years, our six year old Golden has been attacked multiple times. Six months ago, our pup was attacked twice on the same outing. First by a husky, then about 20 minutes later by two Rottweilers while on Fiesta Island. During both attacks, the owners weren't anywhere nearby, and it was everything we could do to calm our boy down and make sure he was uninjured on that trip.

Two weeks ago, the only dogs on the beach were our two dogs and a third male poodle - along with the poodles owners/family. We were at the beach for less than 3 minutes when the poodle aggressively and unprovoked attacked my boy and was pushing and holding him under water. I ran to help my pup while the owners of the poodle pretty much did nothing. Even though this all happened in less than 30 seconds I finally was able to pull the dogs apart at the expense of having my left ring finger bitten off (held on by part of a tendon and a tiny bit of skin). The owner had a bandage and helped me wrap the hand and dangling by a tendon finger in the bandage. My wife then had to load the two dogs back I to the car and rush me to the Veterans Hospital ER in La Jolla where they ended up cutting to remaining tendon and skin away, and due to the injury had to amputate half of my finger. While I was being treated, my wife rushed back to Fiesta Island to get important information such as has the dog been vaccinated for rabies and such. Of course, the family packed up and skedaddled out of the area before any information or police report could be written.

In each of these instances, the attacks were unprovoked, and our pup knows that to avoid conflicts, he should swim out into deeper water where most dogs won't follow. This last attack, by a poodle, another water dog him trying to swim into deeper water didn't help."" [https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/1m17rse/tired\_of\_san\_diego\_dog\_beaches\_being\_out\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/1m17rse/tired_of_san_diego_dog_beaches_being_out_of/)",1,1759012156.0

They 100% have the best atmosphere and vibes or any of the vibes based restaurants. It’s not even close. When good recipes and cooking videos have made high quality home cooking more accessible than ever, going out to eat, especially on a date night or when friends are in town or even just like a monthly get together with friends, needs to deliver more than just food. There’s now two types of restaurants. There’s convenience and there’s destination. The Disneyland comparison is apt I think.  As if that’s an insult. Disneyland is immaculate. Their experience is immaculate. Their food is much higher quality than should be expected for the experience they offer. 

Consortium prices are elevated but not absurdly so. Pick any other bar in OB, PB, North Park. Drinks are not any pricier at a consortium place than any random neighborhood bar and are indisputably better quality. Food is slightly higher than any other random place but also still well above average. 

If I am going out on a date night or bringing friends into town and want good atmosphere and good food and don’t want to pay Michelin prices, it’s basically a Consortium restaurant, Trust, or Kingfisher. 

Mabel’s is my favorite restaurant in town, and they have great vibes but they’re pricier than any consortium place and the vibes aren’t as good. Food is world class and vibes are still great. Fort Oak is pricier and isn’t as much of an escape. Literally any other place downtown is either just as good, less of an escape, and costs just as much. Or you could go to UTC and hit Javier’s which is just as vibey but pricier. Or Din Tai Fung which is pricier. 

Or Juniper and Ivy which tastes better but is pricier and not as good of vibe.

1.  You can see how his formal education informs his art.  He has a sculptor's attention to anatomy that shines in large pieces, and a painter's eye for color mixing which shows in the backgrounds he wraps around central subjects to add depth and define space.


2.  I had one design session with him before actually going under the needle.  I felt like he listened respectfully to my vague ideas, and  made suggestions for how to turn those ideas into a finished piece that weren't just steam rolling over my opinion.  The whole process felt really interactive.


3.  The actual tattoo was done in one 6'ish hour appointment.  I'm a pretty quiet person.  6 hours of needle work doesn't phase me but 6 hours of conversation? Hell no.  So it was a huge plus that he was cool with me just chilling on the table and shifting around whenever he needed to reach more skin, and I was happy to let him put his mental focus into the work rather than listening to me talk about my job or relationships or whatever.  😆",2,1758996139.0

 There's actually a [whole Wikipedia article about the deportation and detainment of US citizens under Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_and_deportation_of_American_citizens_in_the_second_Trump_administration#Unidentified_4_and_7-year-old_siblings), but I'm sure that kind of information doesn't get posted in your echo chambers.

Here are some more articles about the grave injustices this admin keeps committing, if your reading isn't as stunted as your logic and empathy seem to be.

But we're a land of laws. Masked thugs shouldn't be able to snatch people off the street at their whims. And when people are detained, they should get legal representation, and their day in court. If they lose, then they get what the law allows, nothing more. They shouldn't be sent to a concentration camp, paid for with US taxpayer money. And they sure as shit shouldn't be flown to a foreign land they've never set foot in before, again, paid for by taxpayer money.

APPLY SUNSCREEN. APPLY IT EVERYWHERE.

If you have skin that has never seen the sun, it will burn. And it will burn EASILY. Having a sunburn on your Vienna Sausage is NOT fun. Nor is it fun when your ass cheeks are burnt. Wearing clothing the next day was extremely uncomfortable; every time I'd shift, I'd rub my underwear across the burnt areas and it was like a scratch on sunburnt skin. Worse, when I'd sit down, it was painful where I got burnt.

1.  https://cdn.bookey.app/files/pdf/book/en/the-2-hour-job-search.pdf

You need to try and “leverage” your network so you’re not spamming resumes into the black hole of the internet. This book helped me understand what that means

2. Any work is work experience, whether you were 16 or it wasn’t paid. You need construct your resume to be specific to the job post as best you can. If you truly have no experience, then you need to do volunteer work for free.

3. Do the cover letter

4. There are no such thing as entry level jobs. All entry level jobs require experience. If the job post asks for a min of 2-3yrs experience, apply anyways. 

If you are getting interviews but not getting hired

You need to practice answering questions.

For every interview you get, annotate the questions and go through them on your own after and create a big document of “all the interview questions I have encountered and their answers”

In general answers work best when they are stories.

Technical interviews are well about studying the subject matter but interpersonal ones are vague. If you are struggling with “tell me about a time x happened and what did you do about it ?” Type questions. You can start by in your sheet answering these questions

1. What are your values? 3 examples

For each value answer the following:

1. What does it mean
2. How does it look like when it’s good
3. How does it look like when it’s challenged
4. How do you address situations when your values are challenged 
5. Give an example story 

This helps by providing you a pillar to turn to when answering ambiguous questions.

If you are motivated and are outgoing enough to talk to a variety of people daily it might be a good opportunity.

In case you are unaware, vendors pay for shelf space in stores and pay rebates to the stores for items they sell while on sale.

In the case of teapards: they (the mfr or their partners) have to physically print them, distribute them, the retailer has to hang them up.

1ntpv12,ngvt147,"There's a lot of interesting things happening in your comment there to unpack, but the first big one is that you seem to be confusing the workings of the consumer facing side of a retail business and the workings of the supplier facing side. 

Vons negotiates with their suppliers/manufacturers to get some rebate on the goods they purchase. Something like 

-Vons: we think we can sell 100 boxes of cereal, we want to pay $0.75/box.
-manufacturer: $0.75 would be tight for us, and we aren't sure you can sell 100 boxes. How about you buy them for $1/box, and tell us how many you sell. We will reimburse you $0.25/box that actually sells, but you have to eat the extra cost if you don't sell enough""

Vons just needs to tell the manufacturer how many they sold. The manufacturer doesn't actually care what the consumer pays.

Vons really wants that lower price per box. So, to incentivize people buying cereal, they give a discount, via a coupon, to the consumer. They might pass the whole $0.25 discount on, or maybe they only pass part of it. But either way, the more people who use the coupon, the less money Vons gets to keep from the rebate. Thus, they lock the coupon behind their app and loyalty program. This also gives them the added bonus of collecting more data on the app users that they can then sell to advertisers, so even more money for Vons.

On the vendor facing side of the company, this system hasn't materially changed in decades. They probably fill out forms and sign things digitally now instead of doing it on paper, but I would be willing to bet a month salary that the ""friction"" you referenced is entirely fake. The fact that other grocery stores in the area *aren't* having this same issue is testament to this as well. 

Also, the lack of in store coupons thing you mention: those have just been replaced with all the ""scan this barcode in the app"" labels you see all over the place. Again, that gives the benefit of driving people to their app (thus, they can track more things and sell more data to advertisers) as well as have less people use the coupons, so the store gets more money. The fact that they don't have them isn't evidence that they are unused relics of the past, but rather it's an active choice by the store driven by desire for greater profits",1,1759174857.0

1ntnofk,ngwfj8g,"I bike daily with my kids on the back of a bike. I use bike lanes a much as I can, which is about 70% of the time. 

Every 2-4 blocks is an obstruction normally on 30th and Park.

Cars, trucks, Ubers, mail cars, or just pedestrians not paying attention blocking the lanes we have. Tons of cars and people wandering in especially on busy nights in the business districts of 30th near University or Park near Adams to the point it is impossible to use those lanes at those times.

Right now, 30th has construction with 4 or 5 metal plates with sharp ridges in the bike lane south of university, only 1 plate in the car lane that has a smoother paving job. Those rides will bust a tire. 

Florida Street bike lane by the circle in Balboa Park is useless. The bike lane is covered in loose gravel and trash, presumably pushed there by street sweepers rather than maintained. I slipped out there two weeks ago. The bike path makes impossible corners at the rotary too if you need to go left. I have learned not to use that lane.

That gravel problem is also an issue on Landis over the highway, the bike paths on the big wide roads near Old Town and mission Bay, and a few other areas.

Plus, all the bike lanes immediately to the left of parked cars makes getting doored risky. Really poor design for the lanes. Almost happened to me a few days ago with my kids on the back, I barely swerved out of the way into the car lane in time.

I also have to be really careful at every intersection when I'm in the lane on the right, and a car going the same direction as me is to my left in the car lane, but makes an unannounced right turn right across the bike lane without paying attention. That happens to me easily once per week, I had a really close call a month ago that I barely skidded out from. In those situations, I would have been safer right in the main car lane because no one would be able to not notice me and cut me off from the left. So when traffic is high or I notice cars not paying attention, I'll have to actually leave the lane and join the flow of car traffic for safety.

The point is, I would love to use the bike lanes - and use them as much as I can - but it's often impossible or more dangerous due to poor maintenance, cars blocking the lane, or cars making dangerous actions (turns, doors,etc) without paying attention. And with two toddlers riding with me, I must be very careful and defensive.

1ns2t47,ngja6p6,"I hate to admit it, but I’m saving so much money on weekly grocery staples using Amazon Fresh. 

I always thought Amazon Fresh was just Whole Foods, and I HATE their “Everyday 365” store brand, which are more affordable but taste like trash. I assumed they didn’t have “regular” brands. Turns out, it’s an entirely different entity that carries all the same name brands as other stores, and their Amazon Fresh generic items have been some of the best I’ve tried. 

I priced out a cart of 20 items I usually get every week, same brands and sizes, (dog food, paper products, milk, eggs, etc) at Ralph’s, Von’s and Amazon Fresh. (I used the “in-store” prices at Ralph’s and Vons to make sure I wasn’t paying the higher delivery prices on their apps.)

EVEN WITH the default driver tip (Amazon Fresh delivers free for orders over $75) the prices shocked me. 

For the 20 items I regularly buy, Amazon Fresh was $20+ dollars less than Ralph’s and $30+ less than Von’s! On just 20 items.

I hate to give Amazon more of my money, but the savings are too good to pass up, and both of those other stores are owned by billionaire corporations, too. The Amazon Fresh order arrives at the time I select (often the same day) everything is packed and separated nicely in paper bags, and the cold and frozen items are even in foil-insulated paper bags. Minimal-to-no plastic.  

The fresh fruits, vegetables and meats have been great, and the Amazon store-brand dairy is fantastic (milk, cottage cheese, shredded cheese, etc.)

If you’ve never tried it, go look up a few of your favorite brands and items and compare the cost.  (ie: A 12-pack of Coke Zero is usually $8.99-$10.99 at both of the other stores. A 24-pack at Amazon Fresh is $11.99.  And it’s like that with almost every item.)

Sorry for the novel. I just had no idea about them and thought it was just overpriced Whole Foods groceries, but I was very wrong.

1ns2t47,ngldpd5,"I'm a big fan of GTM Stores in Santee and Chula Vista. (The Lemon Grove location closed a few months ago.)

GTM sells surplus foods from grocers including Sprouts, Whole Foods, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. Most are at a big discount while others are abound sales prices. The key is to understand that Best By dates are guides to freshness and edibility. I say that as I eat a bowl of Bob's granola that ""expires"" next week with Clover milk that ""expired"" yesterday. The granola was in an bulk bag of 20 lbs for $7 after a 30% off rewards coupon. The milk was $0.40 a half gallon after a 20% off rewards coupon. Both taste and smell just fine.

Grocery Outlet had a saying back before they became more mainstream: ""Shop us first"". GTM is the same. I go to GTM about once a week. Half the time they have ""natural"" milk and eggs in stock at a great price. If not, I either wait for the next trip or go to ALDI or Sprouts for their store brands for a few dollars more.

Like to the old Grocery Outlet, no fresh produce or fresh meat. Sometimes frozen produce and ""family-size"" packages of frozen meat, as well as frozen plant-based meats.

It is a few more minutes drive for me: Santee shopping is twenty to twenty-five minutes versus the fifteen to get to my closest shopping district. But the drive is worth the savings!

In addition to the dry, chilled, and frozen groceries, GTM has discount clothing, household goods, personal goods, and electronics.

GTM has weekly ads with a variety of discounts. And random sales promotions that last a day or weekend.

I am disappointed that it is really hard to see the clerk enter the prices and discounts, with receipts that only give the department. So my somewhat OCD wife gets upset if a discount didn't get applied by that clerk. But I remind my wife that other clerks have found ways to give bigger discounts.",1,1759031102.0

Short term rental taxes should be *at least* as heavy as hotel taxes, and ideally heavier. San Diego isn't like other cities - we have great hotels in great locations at every price point, and we should nudge the tourists toward them.


There will always be some demand for Airbnbs, for various reasons, and that's fine - I don't think we should ban them.

It was $120 per person (or more if you want a weekend), but for me it was most worth it to see the cats when they were most active, and, of course, to be up close with a cheetah.

Looking at many of the stores that are closing, I think the features I highlighted above are ones the company is aiming to get rid of. I know their official statement claimed that they were going to use these closures to focus on renovating other stores, but I really don't buy it. I think they want to eliminate locations that take up larger footprints, while not achieving maximum throughput. It's also not just Starbucks doing this--I've noticed that other fast casual spots, such as Chipotle, have been reducing seating and have redesigned in ways that feel less inviting overall.

1nraudv,ngiaba7,"It's from one of the Halloween episodes from the golden years of *The Simpsons*.

Kang and Kodos are the two aliens who try to take over Earth in various Halloween episodes. In one of them, they kidnap Bill Clinton and Bob Dole - the two candidates for POTUS in 1996 - and assume their identity.

Eventually, their secret is revealed, but since they are already on the ballot there's nothing American voters can do but vote for one of the two. Kang ends up winning and enslaves Americans. At the end of the episode, Marge complains about their enslavement and Homer says, ""Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos.""

It is meant to highlight both the fact that we have a very narrow choice for POTUS each cycle and are often forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. It also is comedic because, presumably, the fate of Earthlings would be the same had Kodos won the election. Plus, it's also a common sentiment among voters.

I was doing spots that were all new to me personally for this crawl so if you do one of your own, my personal favorite Neapolitan spots I'd recommend are Siamo Napoli, Tribute, and probably either Caffe Calabria or Blade 1936. If you want to make it more convenient for yourself, I'd hit up three spots that are in North Park: you could do Siamo Napoli, Tribute, and Caffe Calabria if you want to stick to strictly Neapolitan; Little Sisters, the Friendly, Lefty's, and Gelati & Peccati all other good options you could swap in if you want to do different styles. North Park in general has the best concentration of pizza spots in SD IMO.

Just keep in mind that Tribute gets really crowded so I would recommend getting a reservation or going when it opens. Also, Siamo Napoli has half off pizzas for happy hour until 6 pm so keep that in mind as well. Overall, this is just my two cents though so your opinion may differ from mine lol",1,1759139555.0

Tribute is expensive and a pain in the butt to get into on weekends, but I've never had an issue on a weekday right at opening at the bar.   What I do like is they use farmers market produce and Bianco DiNapoli tomatoes.  They also use central milling high mountain bread flour, which is how seriously he takes his pizzas and breads. 

 It makes everything more expensive, but I will pay bc I know my $26 pizza is made with really good ingredients.

Since Sonny's is owned by the ppl who run Madison and Madi, it's likely their ingredients aren't as local or specifically as honed in as tribute.  I dunno.

* Dosa Studio, particularly the lunch buffet
* Charminar is overall very good. Their curries do tend to be quite rich, but are still tasty, and biryani is good too.
* San Idli is the spot for dosa. The breakfast and lunch thali are both essential to try as well
* Mirch Masala is great for North Indian staples. Their chole bhature is the best I've tried in town.
* Sattvik is always good and has interesting menu items you won't find anywhere else. If you're not familiar, look up the Sattvik diet before you go to set the proper expectations
* Anjappar is relatively new and specializes in Chettinad cuisine. Their paneer biryani is super good. I'm told their signature dish is mutton but I'm vegetarian so can't comment on it.
* Rasraj has some unique dishes like khaju khoya, and great snacks/wraps
* Village Indian might have the best takes on Punjabi classics in the area, and chole bhature is very good
* Eggholic has tasty egg curries, and their sandwiches look good too
* Annapurna has a Thursday veg dinner buffet, which might be the only one at that time.

Also not all restaurants are using that verbiage. 

You’re recycling and parroting the same thing said. 

It’s not your job to make sure people are paid well. So if they weren’t you’d be fine with it. 
What is a liveable wage to you? 

In San Diego the needed hourly rate for a single person to live comfortably is 30.00 an hour. 
But you’re also someone that probably thinks a line cook or a cleaner at a hotel isn’t worth that much. 

That’s just not happening in these establishments 

I’m merely trying to explain to you why businesses are doing this I’m sure not all are for the right reasons but there’s a good reason why hundreds of businesses didn’t survive COVID in San Diego county, 

Callie isn’t upset you’re not going back. In fact when anyone uses that as a threat we’re like thank god.

Also it’s funny you completely ignored the fact that if you ask for the fee to be removed they’ll gladly do it but instead you’re happier just being a dick

Also I checked and you’re right they provide health insurance for their employees which most restaurants don’t. Once again if you don’t want to pay it you’re not obligated but you’d rather just complain online.

So rather than argue I gave them sound advice on what to do when they’re approached with the fee: ask for it to be removed. I’ve had maybe 5 customers be unhappy with ours in the last 2 plus years and I didn’t even flinch just removed it for them. 

I understand it’s not great. But food costs are high. No one can live off $18 an hour anymore: it’s just not feasible. But this persons replies show me it’s just something for them to bitch about. And so it is.

Strict vegan is a little harder, but there are still lots of options.  You didn't say how large your group is, but if it's fairly small you might enjoy Miss B's Coconut Club.  They have a few vegan items and have meat items. It's famous for it's punch bowl in a giant copper flamingo (always fun for groups). It's about a 15 minute walk from the Catamaran. If your group likes Indian, Spice Lounge is unfussy and very vegan-friendly. It's about an 11 minute walk from the Catamaran. If the rest of your group is willing to go full vegan, Vulture just recently opened and is a very upscale all-vegan restaurant. It's getting rave reviews even from die-hard meat eaters. But that would be a 20 minute drive.

Full disclosure: I have not yet tried them but have read quite a bit about their story. They were supposed to be opening a shop on El Cajon Blvd but construction seems to be dragging on 😭

1nvevi5,nh8u0os,"Fellow tribe member here.
Slowly trying all the different bagels in San Diego. Nothing has been incredible yet. A few places we’ve tried:

Great: 
- golden bagel in Rancho Penasquitos
- nomad donuts - Montreal style. I like their bagel sandwiches 
- Point Loma bagels - cash only

Average-decent:
-  mission bagel
- busy bee bagel (in La Jolla)
- signature bagel (I thought their pumpernickel was very good though)

Bad:
-  Bruegger
- Gold Coast - I don’t know why people love it. It tasted more of white bread in the shape of a bagel. Not enough seasoning on the bagel, nor did it have the right texture, size or density. The price felt fair though, which I appreciated because bagels in SD are weirdly expensive 
- porchlight/desperado bagels: boycotting this place strictly because they charge $5.50 for just the bagel, not including tax. No bagel is worth that. ",1,1759348971.0

North Park in general has the best concentration of pizza spots in SD IMO.

Just keep in mind that Tribute gets really crowded so I would recommend getting a reservation or going when it opens.

Tribute is expensive and a pain in the butt to get into on weekends, but I've never had an issue on a weekday right at opening at the bar.   What I do like is they use farmers market produce and Bianco DiNapoli tomatoes.  They also use central milling high mountain bread flour, which is how seriously he takes his pizzas and breads. 

 It makes everything more expensive, but I will pay bc I know my $26 pizza is made with really good ingredients.

Since Sonny's is owned by the ppl who run Madison and Madi, it's likely their ingredients aren't as local or specifically as honed in as tribute.  I dunno.

* Dosa Studio, particularly the lunch buffet
* Charminar is overall very good. Their curries do tend to be quite rich, but are still tasty, and biryani is good too.
* San Idli is the spot for dosa. The breakfast and lunch thali are both essential to try as well
* Mirch Masala is great for North Indian staples. Their chole bhature is the best I've tried in town.
* Sattvik is always good and has interesting menu items you won't find anywhere else. If you're not familiar, look up the Sattvik diet before you go to set the proper expectations
* Anjappar is relatively new and specializes in Chettinad cuisine. Their paneer biryani is super good. I'm told their signature dish is mutton but I'm vegetarian so can't comment on it.
* Rasraj has some unique dishes like khaju khoya, and great snacks/wraps
* Village Indian might have the best takes on Punjabi classics in the area, and chole bhature is very good
* Eggholic has tasty egg curries, and their sandwiches look good too
* Annapurna has a Thursday veg dinner buffet, which might be the only one at that time.

I've had mixed results with Royal India, Indian Tandoor, and Masala House, and would rather go to one of the other establishments above.

We started with some icebreaker questions and then chatted like old friends. Several women came alone, but we had a few partners attend.

The ages of the participants ranged from their 20s to 50s, with some having been partnered for years while others were newly married. We were having so much fun getting to know one another that everyone stayed past the end of the event. We concluded the evening by exchanging phone numbers and starting a group chat.

Now we have a group of Bi+ wives and new friends, and we're already planning our upcoming events, including a potluck picnic and holiday parties. If you're a partnered bisexual woman in the San Diego area, we would love for you to join us. Please DM me for more details.",1,1755820617.0

1jhmbpm,mj8w0rk,"I am playing Pantheon's early access right now which is a more modern take on EQ which players say has some familiar elements of WoW, Vanguard, and EQ2 combat. It is EA though and 1.0 won't be release for a few years. I play with my cousin who lives across the country and we both played EQ as young teens together so lots of nostalgia and we are having a lot of fun.

The other games I am personally interested are Monster & Memories (also an EQ like game) and Ashes of Creation, both I think won't come out for a few years but have ways to play beta/early access.

There are private servers for games like Dark Age of Camleot (old World PvP game I loved) and other games like Warhammer RoR.

I don't know the whole list, but I am pretty open to playing an old MMO on private, early access/beta, or new MMO. The group is definitely supposedly be laid back, casual, and social, so as long everyone just enjoys chatting and grouping together I feel it will be good, and if a new MMO came out we could switch to that whenever.

I am for playing whatever and the group can always switch games together as long as we are having a good time.",1,1742695586.0

Also Pink7 on Instagram, same vibe, they did an epic sober pool party recently. They're mostly North county, but starting to do some down here including a sober rave a few weeks ago that was super fun.

1ixphav,mhbm906,"Hey! I actually run a community for those in their 20s to 40s that meets in sober spaces. It's called All Peers No Pressure, you can find us on Instagram. We host a lot of free events and our next is a yoga class and picnic at Morley Field this Saturday (March 14th) and after that we will have a game night at Lestat's in Hillcrest (March 21st). Our main thing is you don't have to live a 100% sober lifestyle, you just have to show up to events sober. We are not focused around recovery like The Phoenix app, we just think it's beneficial to make friends willing to do things away from alcohol and substances. My name is Christina and I work hard to make these spaces inviting for anyone in the age group no matter your gender, race, sexual orientation or all that (the age limit is only in place because I find it helps us make friends in similar life stages). I would love to have you at an event and I can answer any questions you may have.

Hi San Diego! Let’s mix and mingle!

The Social Hour (@thesocialhoursd) and Black & Grey Atelier (@blackandgreyatelier) are bringing you After Hours—a social mixer for people in their mid-20s to 30s—on February 8 at San Diego’s newest speakeasy, Dive Bar (inside Black & Grey Atelier)!

This is a low-pressure event for people to meet, so no awkward icebreaker activities, it’s up to you who you talk to! Since it is the month of love, singles will wear a bracelet to make it easy to spot who’s open to meeting someone new.

Enjoy curated cocktails, small bites, and flash tattoos available for purchase throughout the night. The flash card preview will drop soon on @thesociahoursd!

Spots are limited—50 women, 50 men! Tickets include a complimentary welcome shot to kick off the night and shake off the nerves! Grab yours now before they’re gone!

Tickets: @thesociahoursd bio or the link below!

1au07xf,kr13ow4,"Whatever you choose to do, you need to be consistent and intentional with people to make friends. The reason it's easy to make friends growing up is because you're all in the same routines to meet people - same classes, same neighborhood, etc. As an adult it's harder, and people only have so much bandwidth - thus, the flakiness for someone they've barely met once. Best friends don't usually have a meet cute. I used to go to meet up once or twice but found I'd rarely see the same people and it was discouraging. I don't like hanging out to feel like networking. 

I highly recommend taking improv at Finest City or something similar that will get you with the same group of people once a week and part of a larger community.

I did the sports league thing at one point and basically relived all my grade school trauma so, I don't blame you.

17rkvpv,k8o2aad,"Ugh as a frequent flier at the Vineyard, please respect the basic courtesy regarding pace of play. It's a fantastic course and playing it has become a fucking nightmare with people lining up every putt like it's the Tour and taking five minutes over the ball for each shot. It's basic accepted courtesy. 

The reason is that golf is a very feel-based sport and waiting ten minutes at the top of each tee box ensures there is zero way to get any kind of rhythm or feel for your swing unless you play literally all the time. 

Its a relatively expensive course, if you want that kind of relaxed atmosphere then find an executive like Balboa or even a course like Admiral Baker. Also on skill level alone, The Vineyard is a really fucking touch choice for beginners. Putting beginners on anything other than an executive is literally purposely trying to make the day worse for your beginner and everyone after you.",1,1699635808.0

1: Pick a group / social activity / sport / hobby..

>Not left. Not right. Forward.

This implies that the left does not want to move forward.

What does centrism even mean?  The great Howard Zinn once said you can’t be neutral on a moving train.

That sentiment applies to government policy.  Either you’re for proposed policy or not.  Centrism, as has been shown in the last 40 years, usually means laissez-faire economic policy that benefits large corporations.  Just look around at the economy today, it’s dominated by behemoth corporations that have outsized market-share in their industries and control prices.

Please don’t let this “common sense” party make you think you don’t have common sense.  Fight for what you believe in because centrism doesn’t mean anything.",5,1683943015.0

13g1p2f,jjz3b3z,This is why we need ranked choice voting and to end first pass the post elections and replace them with proportional representation in the government,5,1683963072.0
13g1p2f,jk0copu,"I agree that you could imply that the Common Sense Party is insulting others by saying that they do not have common sense. I will be honest. I don't love the name of the party for that reason. But that is not the meaning of the name. They want to elect state leaders that are solutions-oriented and will work on ""common sense solutions"" for California's problems.

The Common Sense party is not ""centrist."" They are not ""moderate."" The party was created in response to the polarization, lack of accurate reporting by the media, increase in propaganda and hate speech, and lack of choice of political candidates that we are currently experiencing. It was created to preserve democracy, increase choice of candidates, give a platform to those who want to run on policy that is not dictated by party leaders. The ""Not right. Not left. FORWARD"" is meant to say ""Let's stop fighting and let's start working together to find solutions."" One of the major goals of the Forward Party and Common Sense Party is to have ranked-choice voting as a way to increase choice of candidates. I'm guessing that a lot of people, both Democrats and Republicans would like this. 

As far as government policy, each candidate can run on a solutions-oriented policy. If you like it, vote for that candidate. If not, vote for a Democrat, Republican, etc. The policy and goals of The Forward Party and CSP are described on the websites so I won't take up more space with that here. 

I also read Howard Zinn's book and he has a lot of good things to say. But his views are one of many that we should listen to. I've also read some of the dialectical philosophers who believe in the process of debate and constructive conversation in order to resolve conflict. I respect your views, but I would ask that you re-think the language you use when engaging in debate. It is easy to sit at a computer and label something as ""dumb"" when you do not have to engage with a human being. You do not have to agree with us or join us, but I would still encourage you to come out and meet us. It is always good to hear people's dissenting views. Besides, one of the goals of this Forward Alliance is to meet the needs of all people so all views are welcome.",-1,1683992425.0
13g1p2f,jjyljhp,"I feel like that’s the point.  

Be vague enough to enlist democrats that will bolster the republican party in a roundabout way.",4,1683950586.0
13g1p2f,jk07qxk,"The Forward Movement is not a typical ""third party."" On a national level, Yang's Forward Party is supporting politicians (Democrats and Republicans) who are committing to collaboration and solutions-oriented government. They are not going to try to run a candidate in the next election. So you could actually support them without supporting a ""third party"". 

As far as having a policy, they do. Preserving democracy. Ensuring choice of candidates for voters. Electing candidates who are responsive to the voters/citizens/people vs. special interests. 

Candidates should be able to run on their own ideas and if you like them, vote for that person. If not, vote for a Democrat, Republican, etc. Anyone who runs for the Republicans and Democrats must  do what they are told by the party leaders or they will not be elected or re-elected. This decreases choice and removes power from the people. Right now both parties are pandering to those with the most extreme views which helps to pit one group against the other. They do not represent a large portion of the people.

As far as the Common Sense Party, they are trying to get recognized as an official party on the California ballot so that we can start electing state representatives that are focused on ""common sense"" solutions for CA's problems. The goal is the same. Increase choice of candidates and allow politicians to have an independent voice. 

One of the goals of the Forward Party has been to have ranked-choice voting in all the states and they are getting major pushback from the Republicans and Democrats, which is very telling. Any competition at all to their chosen candidate (even from candidates in their own party) is a threat to the power of politicians who have been in office too long. They have created a system that works really well for them but not so well for the rest of us.",-2,1683990240.0
13g1p2f,jk0fsf3,"The immediate goal of the Common Sense Party is to get recognized as an official party on the CA ballot. Otherwise we cannot realistically compete with the 2 major parties. The overall goal is to increase choice of candidates for voters and elect politicians who are responsive to the people and not special interests. 

Overall, the policy is collaborative and solutions-oriented. It is to preserve democracy by ensuring that voters have choices and that candidates are responsive to the people who elected them. Candidates will get to run on their own ideas. If you like them, vote for that person. If not, vote for a candidate of another party. They will not support a candidate if that person does not represent all voters/citizens/people or anyone who engages in hate speech or divisiveness. 

One of the major goals right now (of the Forward Party and CSP) is to have ranked-choice voting, which will increase voters' choices and hopefully encourage more people to vote in local and state elections. Only a small percentage of elected officials are at the federal level. The majority of our politicians are in state and local offices. And they have a lot of power over our daily lives. 

As far as the Forward Party, they are not going to run a candidate in the next election. They have committed to supporting candidates (both Democrat and Republican) who have committed to collaboration and who have rejected divisiveness and hate. 

With the constant propaganda of social media and the destruction of investigative journalism, we have been left with a society that is extremely divided. It is so easy to spread mis-information online. We need to get involved in our communities and start meeting the human beings behind the computer screens. I encourage people to come out even if you don't agree with us or want to join the movement. Unless you are extremely rich, the only way to have influence over your government is with numbers. People need to organize and show those in power that we have the ability to remove them from office if they do not serve the people.",-2,1683993792.0

13g1p2f,jk4f891,"No worries. I am not trying to convert people. I personally feel that the fact that we are seriously looking at another Trump presidency is a clear indication that something is seriously wrong with the current system. This is true not just in the United States but around the world. I would love to see people turn out for this Forward Movement because I believe in what they are doing. But, ultimately, I hope that people will go out into their communities and organize. It can be with people who are members of your chosen political party. Or it can be some other group. Doesn't matter. Pick an issue. Find out who all your local and state representatives are. Share that info with the group. Pick an issue and talk about what can be done to improve the situation. Encourage people to write a letter to your representatives stating what legislation you would like to see. And if your group shares the same values as another group, join together. That's what the Forward Alliance is doing. We are tired of being manipulated by both sides. Whatever gains you feel your side has made will be undone by the other side as soon as they are elected (and inevitably they will be). Many people are currently suffering the consequences of this dysfunctional way of governing. Consensus government is a more pragmatic way of governing. That is what Andrew Yang of the Forward Party is currently doing in Washington. And, I believe, he is intentionally not going to try to run a candidate because he does not want to dilute the vote. They are more focused on trying to get ranked-choice voting in as many states as possible. Anyway, thanks for listening and have a great week!",2,1684075859.0

Where a sign doesn't work, it'll have to be a fence. Or I guess just lighten up about your dirt? I dunno. But it's your dirt. If you care, and you put up a sign to let me know, I'll have my dog under control.

The other one is lawns. Dog pee can screw up some grasses, and little kids often play on lawns, so the more thoughtful dog owners avoid those yards too.

Montgomery field and Gillespie field and Ramona airport are all critical to the region and serve many purposes.   Law enforcement, medical, training, and a relief of congestion on an already overtaxed San Diego Airport downtown.

Absolutely a critical part of San Diego aviation and should be protected from locals trying g to change it .  In almost every case, the complaints come from people who bought their home after 1950.

What's more likely is a ballot initiative which would require a signature collection campaign, a GOTV campaign, and a win at the ballot box.

Either of these processes will require several years, probably 3-5 but that number can vary wildly depending on who you ask. As I said in another comment, the best time to switch to a publicly owned utility was 100 years ago, the second best time is now.

I've been working on this for two years now, here are the top arguments in opposition I've heard:

1 - The city can't run a utility/the government is inefficient

2 - The cost would be too high, rate payers would be paying more if we did this

3 - Apathy

My answers:

1 - No city elected would be managing the day to day operations of this proposed publicly owned utility. The city would own it, but it would not operate it. From a day to day operations perspective, there wouldn't be much of a change. It wold be like a business to business acquisition - all the experienced employees, line men, call centers, IT etc. that currently operate the grid would stay on. An independent governing board with representatives from various stake holder groups (unions, businesses, consumers etc.) would hire a CEO to manage the day to day - a similar structure to Sacramento's utility SMUD.

\*Public Power San Diego is a non-profit educational campaign. The details of governance would be spelled out exactly in a ballot initiative. The point is, there's a lot of flavors of public power governance that all have pluses and minuses. I encourage you to do some research or attend an in-person educational event that we host to ask questions and learn more.

2 - This report we just released pretty much destroys this argument. If you take a totally objective look at these models - public power is a total slam dunk for rate payers. This report confirms something that I think most of us feel when we get our SDGE bills but don't have the technical expertise to study/articulate... we are totally getting ripped off by a ""regulated"" for-profit monopoly.

Switching to public power will save all of us a huge chunk of money on day one and an astronomical amount of money over 30 years.

The ""regulated"" for-profit monopoly structure is inherently flawed. It incentivizes regulatory capture and excessive infrastructure spending. We have to fight against this ""regulated"" for-profit monopoly every inch when it comes to rooftop solar, battery storage, and transitioning to a green economy because doing those things isn't profitable for SDGE - that is there primary motivation in all decision making at the highest level of operating a utility. For SDGE and other IOU's across the state, profit always comes first above people and planet.

3 - Apathy is the hardest argument to overcome honestly, I hope we can inspire the people of San Diego to fight for our common material gain. We are ALL getting ripped off and we ALL have so much to gain from this fight.

1nvavb3,nh99gxz,"Not quite for Texas, former Texan here. ERCOT is a nonprofit in charge of balancing grid demand and supply, the state government's partisan PUC oversees ERCOT. Most of the power plants are privately owned. ERCOT kinda operates like uber corporate, they set the wholesale rates for electricity given the current demand and estimated capacity. 

Electricity providers manage distribution costs from the wholesale market to the consumers. I only lived in Austin where our only provider was Austin Energy, but in Houston you could pick based on your usage patterns (more nights, weekends) since the providers could leverage cheaper expected wholesale rates at different times of day vs flat rates. 

So this model struggled mightily during the big Texas freeze (I was there). My personal conspiracy theory is the wholesale rates were capped and NG prices spiked so it became less or unprofitable to generate electricity for the power plants. Regardless if that happened, ERCOT is in charge of making sure the grid stays on frequency before delivering electricity, and there was no way to balance demand other than shutting off demand as gas pipes froze.

For the providers side, it was kinda a mess. Griddy Energy sold to consumers at the wholesale rate and while the freeze started they were begging people to cancel their accounts to prevent $9000/mwh charges. 

All in all an ok system I actually paid less in Austin than my Houston friends even with only one provider. Also Texas has more opportunity for arbitrage given the unique but predictable power demands since it's so effing hot in that state for 5-7 months.",1,1759353367.0

Taking transmission would be decent - there’s no reason for Sempra to keep it as a revenue generating option (it’s lower margin), so they’ll fight twice as hard. Offering for it sweetens the pot

SMUD and LADWP did this when they were much smaller and less sophisticated, it was much cheaper for them and less legally challenging

The graphic distorts the picture because SMUD and LADWP are on flatter terrain, denser, no as high wildfire risk, and both own their generation where SDGE does not. We’re not going to see rates like theirs for a long time, or if we do it’s because costs shifted elsewhere on the bill

The fixed cost to build and maintain the grid is way bigger for SDGE than for LADWP, because SDGE's grid has to cover a huge area of mountainous, fire-prone terrain. At the same time, there are fewer customers from which to collect revenue to pay for that grid. So, SDGE's higher fixed cost is spread out over a smaller population, leaving each customer with a larger burden to bear.

A 2 billion estimate on the buyout is unrealistic, an EDU (for everyone else: distribution within the city only, SDGE keeps the transmission lines) can shave some of the buyout cost (maybe another billion for transmission), but the final sale is still likely in the 4-5 billion range instead of 4-6).

As a matter of intuition, I think Sempra would have even less appetite for a partial buyout than a full, especially since EDU is a greater revenue center, but this is just conjecture

**Airport stuff:** TSA and air traffic controllers still show up but don’t get paid. Security lines should be okay at first but if this goes on for weeks expect delays and longer waits. That’s what happened in the 2018-2019 shutdown when people started calling out.

**Military:** This is the big one for San Diego. All active duty keep working but paychecks stop. Navy and Marines make up a huge chunk of the local population so when they’re not getting paid the whole economy feels it. Restaurants, shops, etc. 

Something like 1 in 10 people in San Diego live in a household where someone works for the government so this could be awful for local, small businesses immediately as impacted folks hold onto the cash they have.

A quick search shows that the reason there was a shutdown was because Dems want to extend the health care credits for middle to low income people getting insurance through ACA. Why is that not worth fighting for? Millions would face hikes in healthcare costs. If our govt can give 20b to Argentina (and then get screwed over) we can extend health credits to our citizens/people living here.

No, federal workers who are furloughed are barred from working. They are placed in a mandatory, unpaid leave status for the duration of a government shutdown.

The rules apply differently for employees designated as ""excepted"" or ""essential"":
- Furloughed (non-essential) employees: These workers are not allowed to perform work and may not volunteer their services. The only work they can do is a minimal amount needed to complete an orderly shutdown of agency operations.
- Excepted (essential) employees: These workers must continue to perform their duties without pay. Examples include law enforcement officers, federal prison guards, air traffic controllers, and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents.
- Back pay: Following a shutdown, both furloughed and excepted employees are legally guaranteed to receive back pay for the time they were out of work or worked without pay.",1,1759360422.0

When I close anything I have to notify caltrans and they update the apps. Not as an anonymous user but as caltrans, so it updates the apps with certainty until we notify them it’s reopened.  Under normal circumstances we are also not allowed to close 2 on or off ramps in a row.  They must alternate 1 open and then 1 closed unless there is no way around it.  If the apps were not updated and multiple ramps in a row were closed then there was an emergency.  I also laugh when people say “I didn’t see anyone there.”  Sometimes you won’t see anyone there.  It takes a lot of time/equipment with anything related to the freeway. Sometimes we’re waiting on crews, equipment, pavement to dry, or it’s generally unsafe to reopen lanes, but we’re not gonna sit on the freeway and expose ourselves while that happens so we leave and find a safe place to hang out in the meantime. Thousands of people will drive through in that time  and think we’re idiots but I’ve explained it until I’m blue in the face and it never makes a difference.

1nuz2nd,nh7fb2j,"When insurance companies send letters to policy holders, they are on company letterhead and include your policy number in the text.

If it doesn't have these things, then it was sent by another party that doesn't know the name of your company or your policy number (which is confidential information)..  Also, If your expiration date is January, don't worry, just find a copy of your policy and call the company itself (not the agent) and ask them if your renewal paperwork for January is ready.  Then you can get into a conversation with them about it.  If your policy was getting non-renewed, your renewal paperwork would just flat out say ""Non-renewal"" and give you the reason why.  If it was being renewed, with some kind of conditions for a better roof, the paperwork would say ""Conditional Renewal"" and something like ""see conditions below"" where it would decribe what needs to be fulfilled in order for them to renew your policy. So it would say something about updating your roof in the ""conditions.""  But it would all be formal paperwork and it would even include your renewal premium amount, which would be contingent upon you meeting the conditions for their renewal offer.

How to handle the phone call to the insurance company: Do not mention this letter up front, just ask the company if your renewal is going to be normal this year or if there are any new conditions for renewal. If there are any problems with your renewal, they will tell you immediately what they are. And if there are none, they will tell you that everything should be processed automatically and you will receive the renewal letter in the mail by such and such date.  They do also typically ask something like ""Well, have you made any improvements or changes to the dwelling within the last year?""

It says:

* Park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors.
* Parks with accessible areas that collect fees under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) will utilize available retained recreation fees balances to provide basic visitor services in a manner that maintains restrooms and sanitation, trash collection, road maintenance, campground operations, law enforcement and emergency operations, and staffing entrance gates as necessary to provide critical safety information.

*So it looks like it might be open and actually cleaned.*


* As a general rule, if a facility or area is locked or secured during non-business hours (buildings, gated parking lots, etc.) it should be locked or secured for the duration of the shutdown.


*This makes it sound like Cabrillo gates will be locked.*

* Park websites and social media will not be maintained, except for emergency communications. Parks will not provide regular road or trail condition updates. As part of their orderly shutdown activities, park staff will post signs notifying visitors that only basic or no visitor services, maintenance, or other management activities will be conducted, and emergency services will be limited.

*You won't know until you actually go there.*

* At the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks’ discretion, parks may close grounds/areas with sensitive natural, cultural, historic, or archaeological resources vulnerable to destruction, looting, or other damage that cannot be adequately protected by the excepted or exempted law enforcement staff that remain on duty

Now the whole area smells like a giant sea lion toilet 24/7, which sucks and is unnecessary.

-manufacturer: $0.75 would be tight for us, and we aren't sure you can sell 100 boxes. How about you buy them for $1/box, and tell us how many you sell. We will reimburse you $0.25/box that actually sells, but you have to eat the extra cost if you don't sell enough""

Vons just needs to tell the manufacturer how many they sold. The manufacturer doesn't actually care what the consumer pays.

Vons really wants that lower price per box. So, to incentivize people buying cereal, they give a discount, via a coupon, to the consumer. They might pass the whole $0.25 discount on, or maybe they only pass part of it. But either way, the more people who use the coupon, the less money Vons gets to keep from the rebate. Thus, they lock the coupon behind their app and loyalty program. This also gives them the added bonus of collecting more data on the app users that they can then sell to advertisers, so even more money for Vons.

On the vendor facing side of the company, this system hasn't materially changed in decades. They probably fill out forms and sign things digitally now instead of doing it on paper, but I would be willing to bet a month salary that the ""friction"" you referenced is entirely fake. The fact that other grocery stores in the area *aren't* having this same issue is testament to this as well. 

Also, the lack of in store coupons thing you mention: those have just been replaced with all the ""scan this barcode in the app"" labels you see all over the place. Again, that gives the benefit of driving people to their app (thus, they can track more things and sell more data to advertisers) as well as have less people use the coupons, so the store gets more money. The fact that they don't have them isn't evidence that they are unused relics of the past, but rather it's an active choice by the store driven by desire for greater profits",11,1759174857.0

1ntnofk,ngxa35w,"Just be aware that a handful of the bike lanes end abruptly and throw you into traffic and parked cars. 

For example on Park just across El cajon blvd, at the intersection of death, there’s a short bike lane adjacent to the new apartment building that has issues… First, it’s blocked at least 25% of the time with a delivery truck or other parked cars in the bike lane, so I take the middle of the regular car lane pretty often. 

Second, there’s a very heavily used right turn section onto mead for cars, so you run the risk of cars doing the dreaded “right hook” (google it). 

There are a good amount of situations where bikes that are going reasonably fast should just take the regular lane as opposed to the designated bike lane. The bike lanes are absolutely essential for  people who are less confident in traffic or going slower on the roads, but there’s are a lot of times where it’s just safer to take the road lane for someone who’s comfortable riding in traffic every day.",2,1759191650.0
1ntnofk,ngwfj8g,"I bike daily with my kids on the back of a bike. I use bike lanes a much as I can, which is about 70% of the time. 

Every 2-4 blocks is an obstruction normally on 30th and Park.

Cars, trucks, Ubers, mail cars, or just pedestrians not paying attention blocking the lanes we have. Tons of cars and people wandering in especially on busy nights in the business districts of 30th near University or Park near Adams to the point it is impossible to use those lanes at those times.

Right now, 30th has construction with 4 or 5 metal plates with sharp ridges in the bike lane south of university, only 1 plate in the car lane that has a smoother paving job. Those rides will bust a tire. 

Florida Street bike lane by the circle in Balboa Park is useless. The bike lane is covered in loose gravel and trash, presumably pushed there by street sweepers rather than maintained. I slipped out there two weeks ago. The bike path makes impossible corners at the rotary too if you need to go left. I have learned not to use that lane.

That gravel problem is also an issue on Landis over the highway, the bike paths on the big wide roads near Old Town and mission Bay, and a few other areas.

Plus, all the bike lanes immediately to the left of parked cars makes getting doored risky. Really poor design for the lanes. Almost happened to me a few days ago with my kids on the back, I barely swerved out of the way into the car lane in time.

I also have to be really careful at every intersection when I'm in the lane on the right, and a car going the same direction as me is to my left in the car lane, but makes an unannounced right turn right across the bike lane without paying attention. That happens to me easily once per week, I had a really close call a month ago that I barely skidded out from. In those situations, I would have been safer right in the main car lane because no one would be able to not notice me and cut me off from the left. So when traffic is high or I notice cars not paying attention, I'll have to actually leave the lane and join the flow of car traffic for safety.

The point is, I would love to use the bike lanes - and use them as much as I can - but it's often impossible or more dangerous due to poor maintenance, cars blocking the lane, or cars making dangerous actions (turns, doors,etc) without paying attention. And with two toddlers riding with me, I must be very careful and defensive.

1ns2t47,ngja6p6,"I hate to admit it, but I’m saving so much money on weekly grocery staples using Amazon Fresh. 

I always thought Amazon Fresh was just Whole Foods, and I HATE their “Everyday 365” store brand, which are more affordable but taste like trash. I assumed they didn’t have “regular” brands. Turns out, it’s an entirely different entity that carries all the same name brands as other stores, and their Amazon Fresh generic items have been some of the best I’ve tried. 

I priced out a cart of 20 items I usually get every week, same brands and sizes, (dog food, paper products, milk, eggs, etc) at Ralph’s, Von’s and Amazon Fresh. (I used the “in-store” prices at Ralph’s and Vons to make sure I wasn’t paying the higher delivery prices on their apps.)

EVEN WITH the default driver tip (Amazon Fresh delivers free for orders over $75) the prices shocked me. 

For the 20 items I regularly buy, Amazon Fresh was $20+ dollars less than Ralph’s and $30+ less than Von’s! On just 20 items.

I hate to give Amazon more of my money, but the savings are too good to pass up, and both of those other stores are owned by billionaire corporations, too. The Amazon Fresh order arrives at the time I select (often the same day) everything is packed and separated nicely in paper bags, and the cold and frozen items are even in foil-insulated paper bags. Minimal-to-no plastic.  

The fresh fruits, vegetables and meats have been great, and the Amazon store-brand dairy is fantastic (milk, cottage cheese, shredded cheese, etc.)

If you’ve never tried it, go look up a few of your favorite brands and items and compare the cost.  (ie: A 12-pack of Coke Zero is usually $8.99-$10.99 at both of the other stores. A 24-pack at Amazon Fresh is $11.99.  And it’s like that with almost every item.)

Sorry for the novel. I just had no idea about them and thought it was just overpriced Whole Foods groceries, but I was very wrong.

I still shop in-store for some items, but for the last 6 months, 90% of my groceries have come from Amazon Fresh and I’ve saved *literally* hundreds of dollars.  🤷🏻‍♂️",9,1759003539.0

Ralphs is Kroger based out of Cincinnati Ohio and if you search for Kroger weekly flyers online you will see the San Diego prices are exact same as midwest prices.

With Ralphs you need to get their shoppers card and go on app to clip coupons and take advantage of their weekly deals.

If you still want some packaged meals, I have found some good and relatively inexpensive stuff at Trader Joe's. Good luck!
