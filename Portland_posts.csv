I saw the SUV (that also ran a red light!) that tried to parallel park and hit a car at OHSU South Waterfront near the aerial tram.  I stopped to take pictures but the owner came out and took some.  I gestured towards the woman who did it but I had a bit of a time sensitive issue to deal with and kind of took off.  I'm sorry, I should have stuck around, but I can be a witness and did take a few photos.  ",0,Portland

How are there not regulations against this?,0,1758830951.0,"11 Hours ago, Blueground just posted 30+ apartments for rent in the Portland area. All are high-end, ""luxury"" apartments. Each is 3x-4x the average cost of a rental of a similar size (7k-12k for 3-4bd apts). I anticipate that this will lead to rent hikes in all the neighborhoods these rentals are located. I am mostly wondering whether anyone else is seeing this and concerned about the negative impacts this will have on Portland neighborhoods. If so is there anything that can be done?",8,Portland

She saw this dog trotting alone, dragging a leash. She picked up the leash and walked around with it for about 30 minutes looking for an owner with no luck.

The humane society requires you to bring the dog to them and she's commuting on her bike today. She doesn't want it to get ran over but also has to go back work. Is there a rescue or a shelter that picks up dogs? Is someone able to pick it up from downtown?

1npjbi7,Expect your PDX water bill to be 6.3% higher (and how to help),203,1758737037.0,"I checked but didn't see a previous post about this. Portland Water Bureau raised rates on July 1 (as they do every year).  If you haven't gotten a quarterly bill since then, here's a reminder to expect it to be higher.

The reasons for these rate increases have been covered in previous threads, but are also [described](https://www.portland.gov/water/customer-service/pay-your-utility-bill/what-your-bill-pays) on PWB's website. (TL;DR: Deferred infrastructure and maintenance, and \*gestures broadly at the economy\*)

Ways to mitigate the impact on your wallet from easiest to hardest:

1. Contact PWB & switch to monthly billing. They still only read the meter every 3 months, but they divide that bill up into 3 equal(ish) payments over 3 months.
2. Sign into your account and make sure you're signed up for Clean River Rewards if eligible (even if you signed up for it years ago- they reset the system a year or two ago and we had to re-signup).
3. If you're still paying by card (debit or credit), they started charging the card processing fee a few months ago. Set up a ""bill pay"" from  your online bank account (your bank sends them money), ACH/payment on your PWB account (PWB draws from your bank), ... or start sending checks in the mail with a stamp, whatever floats your boat.
4. **Even if you are a renter**, [get the water free efficiency kit from PWB](https://www.portland.gov/water/water-efficiency-programs). DO NOT SLEEP ON HOW MUCH MONEY (WATER) YOU CAN SAVE BY CHANGING YOUR AERATORS! If you have a 2.5 gallon per minute (gpm) showerhead (standard since 1992), switching to the 1.5 gpm will save you FORTY PERCENT of your shower water use. Even if you only have a 2 gpm (""water sense"" labelled), it will still save you TWENTY FIVE percent. Ditto with kitchen sink aerator. Tenants can easily do these changes, you just need a towel and possibly an adjustable wrench or vise grip if it's really stuck on. (Caveat: a lot of newer sink faucets have either a proprietary ""key"" that you need to get the aerator out, that you can buy the key online; or they require a different kind of aerator, which in many cases you can still get from a big box store online for $4-7.)
5. Hopefully you don't have any leaks, but if you do, fix it with the above free kit and/or call a professional. Then ask PWB for a refund (they will refund some cash for fixed leaks)
6. PWB has info about [deferring bills](https://www.portland.gov/water/customer-service/pay-your-utility-bill/request-payment-arrangement) & [financial assistance](https://www.portland.gov/water/customer-service/apply-financial-assistance) on their page. Eligibility for financial assistances starts at $52,128/year or less gross income for a single person, $67,020 for a family of 3, etc.
7. If you're a homeowner or otherwise fairly settled long term, consider investing $100 or so in a timer and a soaker hose for your summer seasonal garden beds and trees. When you're re/planting any yard areas, consider adding trees to shade plants and reduce their water use (and lower your cooling bill), and natives from the Portland Plant List, which will generally require little or no water if you plant them in areas similar to their usual habitat. (If you have a dry, hot, exposed area, plant plants from section 2.7 and 2.8a ""prairie"" and ""dry rocky outcrops."" If you have a dry shady area under trees, section 2.1 ""western hemlock-douglas fir forest."" Etc.",75,Portland

1np8e28,59 Dogs at the Troutdale Shelter!,223,1758709098.0,"Dear Portlanders, the Multnomah County Animal Shelter has 59(!) dogs right now. That is the most I have ever seen. They are a kill shelter fyi. Anyone looking for a new friend or family member? Or has anyone ever considered fostering for them? Or volunteering to walk dogs?

Oregon Humane Society and Oregon Dog Rescue, for example, have much better systems for volunteering, fostering, and adopting, but these dogs at MCAS are just as deserving and really need us.  
  
Check them out: [MCAS dogs](https://www.multcopets.org/adoptables?adopt%5B0%5D=species%3ADog&page=1)

ETA: since some people prefer to live in their fairytale world, to be considered a “no kill shelter,” a shelter must have a 90% live rate or higher. They have been under 90% for a few years and removed “no kill” from their website. You can check the stats on their website and there is an article I will find about this. Their official euth policy of 3/24 mentions considering kennel capacity, limited options for transfer or foster, available resources, etc

Update: there are now 62!
  
Anyway, here are a few of their sweet faces:

Used it the evening prior but found it gone the next day with the lock cut and the AirTag I'd placed  in a pretty hidden spot was found trashed in a garden near 33rd street.

I've been checking online marketplaces like Facebook and eBay with no luck and would be super grateful for any tips or if you happen to see it listed, dumped, or for sale!! The bike was in pretty good condition except for a small scratch on the display, super scuffed up pedals, and had the rubber charging port missing last I saw/used it.

Day 1:  
Flew in from SFO, ended up driving down to Eugene to watch the Emeralds play (big SF Giants fan). Drive there reminded me a lot of the Central Valley back in CA.

Day 2:   
Went to Screen Door for brunch. The shrimp and grits were terrific! Didn't realize how much food it was going to be or I wouldn't have ordered the fried okra but was not mad about it at all. Explored Hawthorne Street afterwards and went thrifting. Didn't find anything I liked (I guess I'm not en vogue) but still loved walking around the neighborhoods. Also extremely appreciate how easy your public transit is! Although I would love a little faster headways. For dinner, I was able to snag a reservation at Langbaan and it was absolutely terrific! Patrick and Molly were lovely and I loved the info on each dish as it was presented.

Day 3:  
Had breakfast at Cheryl's which was probably the weakest of all the meals I had (I know it was controversial on here but decided to try anyways). Just overpriced and meh. But afterwards, I went up to the Rose Test Garden as well as the Japanese Garden and I LOVED both. I found myself coming back to the rose garden a couple times in my explorations on this day and it was an instant mood lifter. Dinner today was at Ox Restaurant which I think was my favorite out of the trip. Forget the gentleman's name who was serving but he was excellent. The tres leches cake for dessert was worth the trip alone! Afterwards, I met up with friends at Scandals(sad that it's closing), and then we went to Silverado and closed at Stag.

Normally the swifts would overnight in hollow snags (standing dead trees), but with the wholesale destruction of most of our old growth forest--and therefore the big, dead trees they need--they've had to adapt to chimneys instead since the 1980s.

As always, it was a picnic atmosphere, with people of all ages sitting on the lawn to watch the swifts dive into the chimney at dusk. There were kids playing soccer, and some amateur acrobats, and as darkness began to fall someone began tossing a glowing foam Nerf ball around. While we waited for the swifts to arrive, we enjoyed the large numbers of crows winging their way overhead as they went en masse to their favorite roosting spots.

And the swifts! I think we counted a flock of at least 400, and more kept coming. I wasn't keeping a really close count, but it easily could have been twice that number with stragglers by the time all was said and done. The biggest flock murmurated like starlings, and a couple of times a hapless crow got caught up in the traffic, an oversized hanger-on entangled with the smaller swifts. They seemed to take longer to go into the chimney, with a few still struggling to find a spot as it got dark, but that may be because they weren't as used to this chimney, or perhaps the mouth wasn't as amenable to easy landings as the one at Chapman. But they all made it in eventually.

*This* is my Portland. This is why I love it here. There are so many people here whose idea of a good time is to sit on a wide grassy lawn with a picnic and a few friends, watching this crowd of tiny insectivorous birds angle their way into an old chimney, cheering every time some of them funnel their way in for a safe landing. I moved here almost two decades ago, and overwhelmingly this has been my experience here. Yes, there are problems, as any city has, but the media overblows this to get clicks and views and create outrage and fear, and people are more likely to speak up with complaints than with praises.

The important thing is to show up for the good stuff, be a part of what you want to see in the community. Let your self-fulfilling prophecy be a positive one.",29,Portland

1nmrvaa,Smoked Out of My Apartment,22,1758461027.0,"Edit: I have an air purifier. All it does is flash red that the air quality is s*** 

I live in a non-smoking Hud apartment complex, and I've been looking for a place to live due to 2nd hand smoke, but none of the apartments are accessible as I use a power chair or Walker.  My current apartment is not habitable due to the smoke - I am in and out of the ER and urgent care and have recently been giving an inhaler due to the constant secondhand smoke in my apartments .

I talked to an attorney and I have no legal recourse against a permissive landlord who does nothing to smokers.  The only thing I could do is file the tort against the neighbors who are smoking. This won't give me my health back, or find a safe place to live.
There are many of them (smokers) and it would do meNo good to sue sue, I just need to get away from the smoke. It's making me sick and my cat sick. I've even called homeless shelters but they won't let me stay because I have an apartment to stay in. 

I thought about buying a cheap van to live in until I can find another apartment, but then there's the whole hassle of parking and safety as a disabled woman sleeping in a van. 

I can pay up to 1,200/month.  Anything I haven't thought of? Tia 🤔",65,Portland

1nmb7xy,Proposal to Revitalize Urban Plaza Downtown,50,1758406566.0,"Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share a passion project of mine that I've been working on, using some of the things I've learned while studying Urban Planning at PSU and hoping to drum up some public support for this campaign.

I'm asking for support in revitalizing the 6th Avenue Fountain Plaza—known to skateboarders as “Half Circle.”

For over 40 years, skateboarders have used this space, but the presence of skate stoppers and other barriers currently limits its potential. Skateboarding fosters creativity, community engagement, and brings economic benefits by increasing foot traffic to local businesses.

I propose a phased approach to improve the Plaza:

Phase 1: Remove existing skate stoppers;

Phase 2: Remove boulders, invest in landscaping improvements, and introduce small, skateable elements.

Additionally, I recommend adding bike racks, seating, a water fountain and other amenities to support sustainable transportation and enhance the experience for all users.

If you feel moved to support this project please consider adding your name to the list of 166 people who have already signed on by filling out this brief Google survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6vcQoWCVQAnUqHLoJTKESmJNegvHYKSf8Jcr-ltLX8Nplvw/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6vcQoWCVQAnUqHLoJTKESmJNegvHYKSf8Jcr-ltLX8Nplvw/viewform)

There is also a section on that form, which is optional, where you can share any vision you have for the space. Feel free to dream big! No bad ideas. I know it's reddit, but I just ask that if you do fill out the form we try to keep the discourse positive, feel free to tear this apart in the reddit comments if you feel the need lol.

The idea is to use skateboarding as a tool to help reactivate this space, but my hope is that a vibrant Half Circle provides as many uses for as many people as possible.

Thanks!

It feels so futile to complain about given how so much of it is a result of bureaucratic decision making and special session delays, but I really worry that someone is going to get killed one of these days. Not to mention all the trash on the shoulders that ODOT doesn’t seem to clean anymore even though the layoffs have been postponed.

Hi there I work at Edwards Vacuum! We are / were a major sub-fab equipment supplier for Intel. They aren't buying systems anymore. We had several rounds of layoffs this year and a furlough. On Tuesday we were notified that only a quarter of us were to remain employed. Everyone else was dismissed that day! We were all given our termination date. Some of us will be gone by November, others by June of next year.

I am a software engineer that works here and my heart is completely ripped out by all of this. Our facility was beautiful, and it was a wonderful working environment. I've worked here for 4 years. I started as an intern and I've made so many memories and friends here. I think our ghosts will forever haunt this building whoever buys it.",52,Portland

1njnnw2,An Obituary for Lito (Or; The Guy Who Couldn't Play Guitar in Pioneer Square),1418,1758139341.0,"August 29^(th), one of our own passed on.  Some of you youngin’s with your new ways of smoking from anything other than a can may not remember him, but there used to be a legend in Pioneer Square—on the corner in front of the Nordstrom Café.  He wore blue latex gloves, a blue hoodie, and rocked a blue Pignose guitar with a built-in amp.  And God was it awful.  He played day and night—for years—decades even—but he never got any better.  He strummed every string he could in 4/8 time.  Didn’t matter where the other hand was on the neck.  All you’d hear when you got close to that corner above the traffic and the screech of the MAX and the homeless was the only song he knew by heart.  TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG—

 

His name was Joselito Abuan.  But my wife and her family called him Tito Tambo.  He was born in the Philippines, in Makati, back in 1961.  Lito wasn’t always like this.  Shouting about how he was a 5-star general and had land in Switzerland.  Believe it or not, he was a prodigy in chess.  Looked forward to becoming an engineer.  And as the only son of 6, his father looked to him like a rising star.  Then back in the 80’s, he moved to Portland with the rest of his family.  He tried to find a pot connection quickly rather than safely, and ended up losing his head.  From the sounds of it, he got a hold of some bad acid which kicked some latent schizophrenia into overdrive.

 

Unfortunately, Lito’s folks were willing to save a buck (“No no,” they’d say, “They just thought he’d do better back home.”  Say what you will).  Lito was sent back to the Philippines, a place known for their incorruptible leadership and understanding of mental illness.  He was sent to jail.  However long he was there was too long.  When he came back to America, he vowed not to return to the old country, and his father vowed that he would be the only caretaker his son would ever need.  Well, heavy smoker that he was, his father passed.  And his mother vowed to be the only caretaker that her son would ever need.  Well, healthy as she was, she was bed-ridden by a stroke and she passed on as well.

 

For the next 40 years, Lito was kicked between his sisters’ homes.  He’d care for their yards, watch their kids, help with the chores… but what really occupied his time was music.  He had a penchant for Fleetwood Mac and Steelers Wheel.  When he played downtown, he didn’t play for cash.  He played for the people.  Just know that when he was hitting every chord, he thought he was playing the same perfect rendition of “Stuck in the Middle With You” that he heard through his Walkman.  He made friends.  There was a man dressed all in blue with a blue turban and a beard dyed blue that Lito brought to his mother’s wake.  He called himself Kenny Loggins and served himself up a mountain of Chinese at the after-service buffet but damn if he wasn’t the nicest guy in the room.  Every month Lito’s family would come down to Pioneer Square and pay his tab at the food trucks that fed him.  Always the same, “He don’t cause no trouble.”

 

When I first met Tito Tambo, I found myself to have gravely misinterpreted what ‘crazy uncle’ meant.  I ended up in a hazing ritual where the entire set up was to just place the new guy in a corner with him.  Dude wouldn’t stop talking.  He talked about the millions he had in multiple accounts.  His military career as a 5-star general.  His airplane that was big enough to live on but all they needed was someone to fly it.  I don’t know why—probably boredom— but I said, “You know, I’m a pilot.”  I was maybe 17 or 18 and the only job I had was at the Dollar Tree.  But for all the past delusions Lito couldn’t remember, he never forgot that I was a pilot.

 

Lito always felt neglected at family parties to me, and I hated that.  I was soon promising to jam with him up in the office.  I pulled a bass off the wall.  We sat in uncomfortable chairs as he slid his headset on.  Guess I’d be following his lead.  “Well I don’t know how I got here tonight—”  Alright, Steelers Wheel it is.  We played together for maybe 20 seconds before he stopped.  “Wait!  Wait!  Wait!  Your bass is out of tune.  Here, give it to me.”  Great, gonna be a pain the ass to—  And then he played ‘Smoke on the Water’ perfectly.  Granted, it might be the first song a bass player learns, but I couldn’t fuckin’ believe it.  And the son of a bitch tuned my bass better than I could, too.  “There.  Okay.  Let’s start again.”  TWANG TWANG TWAND TWANG TWANG TWANG—  He was still better at chess than you, too.

 

Lito fell ill back in March.  Couldn’t swallow his food.  Turned out to be esophageal cancer.  I guess being a lifelong smoker will do that to you.  He didn’t want to go through with radiation therapy, though.  Thought that was the thing that killed his dad.  But once his sisters paid him a couple hundred bucks to go, he was ready to entertain them.  Didn’t believe it would work, of course, but told me as we sat in his hospital room that he was doing it to keep his sisters from nagging him.  Instead, he believed his home remedy would be the cure: he was gonna yank out his molar, focus on dental hygiene, and drink a mixture of peanut oil and rubber.  He tells me this as I look over his head and notice that his emergency contact is listed simply as ‘Kasparov”, the reigning champion of chess in the 80’s.

 

Who knows, maybe Tito Tambo had gotten the chance to try his own methods he’d still be annoying the passer-by’s in Pioneer Square today.  Instead, he passed August 29^(th) at the age of 64.  We buried him yesterday.",94,Portland

1nj0k3c,Need to rehome my cat (NE Portland),44,1758074294.0,"Hi, Portland,

We need to rehome my cat Lucy, who is not getting along with my roommate's dog and is experiencing stress.  Here's my write-up for Adopt-A-Pet:

Lucy is a healthy Female 3 year old, black/ white long haired, indoor/outdoor cat.

She is cute and cuddly and loves to curl up on the bed next to your leg or between yourself and your laptop.  She is a sweetheart and will be dearly missed.  She is intelligent, good with doors and rather quiet.

She also likes her YouTube cat TV.

For her best life, she needs a single pet home or a home with another cat (but no dogs). Due to some experiences in her first year (in her first home before ours), she does not get along well with dogs and is nervous around children under age 10.  She has otherwise done well with the other cat in our home.

She is spayed and is under the care of Hannah Pet Society in NE Portland.  You may assume our monthly dues ($79/month for any and all vet care) if you wish.

We will send her with bags of food, her feeder, carrier, litter box and toys, all of which will help her to acclimate to her new home.

1ni5kqj,Paranormal Lloyd center,91,1757989735.0,"Since the Halloween season is upon us, I’ve been bringing this story up more and am curious if anyone working at the Lloyd center has ever experienced something similar.
Back when Spencer’s was still at the Lloyd center I worked there for a couple months before it closed and had some real freaky things go on that weren’t explainable. The biggest is what I call the White Windbreaker guy. 
I was alone in the store for a bit while my manager was in the back and I saw a guy in a white windbreaker with his hood up walk around a corner. I could hear his windbreaker too and I didn’t see him walk in so I went to greet him. I turned the corner maybe a few seconds after him and he was completely gone. I checked the hallway outside the store and didn’t see him anywhere. Few days later I’m asking my coworker there if they had seen anything, and they say they once saw a guy in a white windbreaker walk around a corner in the store and then vanish. That freaked me out but then things escalated. 
A couple weeks later we’re closing the store then what sounds like loud hammering shoot’s up and down the wall connecting us to an empty storefront. It shook the whole wall. I check the store next to us to see if anyone’s working in there and the lights are off and completely empty. Freaked me the fuck out. 
I haven’t really been able to ask anyone working there if they’ve had any similar experiences to that while at the Lloyd center so, if you’ve ever had any paranormal activity happen to you at the Lloyd center I’d love to hear it!!! The white windbreaker guy still freaks me out!",29,Portland

Sweet, healthy malamute waiting at MCAS since June",675,1757986471.0,"Coco is a sweet, beautiful 12 year old malamute who has been waiting at Multnomah County Animal Shelter (MCAS) since June, more than three months without a family. No senior dog should have to stay in the shelter this long!!!

[Link to Coco's Adoption Page](https://www.multcopets.org/adoptable/358684)

Coco came in as a stray with his sister, who had been with him his entire life. Sadly, when their owner was contacted, they said they no longer wanted them. His sister was quickly adopted, but Coco was left behind. Losing both his home and his companion broke his heart. He stopped eating, cried and howled all night, and lost over 10 pounds.

I fostered him for 3.5 weeks this summer and he was the most wonderful companion. He loves lounging in the yard, checking on his people, going for short walks, and even gets the cutest zoomies. He is potty trained, has great recall (fellow dog owners know how important this is!!!), is calm in the house, and bonds deeply with his humans.

Importantly, Coco is also in excellent health for his age! He has great mobility and still has lots of playful energy. Honestly, if I did not know his age, I would never guess it.

The best part is that Coco is a very chill dog. He is not high-energy or demanding, so he is perfect for someone who wants a sweet, steady companion without needing to run around all day. He loves his daily walk, then is happy to relax and soak up love. His mellow nature, cute malamute howl, and older gentleman personality make him an absolute treasure. He’s even a great brew dog!! I took him to a couple breweries where he settled easily and happily soaked up attention from anyone who came to say hi.

Last month, MCAS even featured Coco on their site after a generous community member donated a grooming session for him. You can see the sweet write-up and an adorable video of his bath here: [https://www.multcopets.org/news/round-apaws-dawb-rub-dub-dog-wash-gives-coco-glow](https://www.multcopets.org/news/round-apaws-dawb-rub-dub-dog-wash-gives-coco-glow)

Coco deserves the best home after everything he has been through. If you are looking for a loyal, goofy, loving senior with so much personality, please consider adopting him from MCAS, located at 1700 W Historic Columbia River Hwy, Troutdale, OR 97060

I also left a message for feral cat coalition - but they are closed until tomorrow. At the very least think they need antibiotics (the wound on their chest is very red and probably infected).

Well, I’d love to try to expand my artistic reach by trying out some designs for other neighborhoods as well.  However, given I don’t live in other neighborhoods I’m not as in-the-know about them.

I’d love some of your knowledge about the neighborhoods YOU live in.  I’m looking for “not the main thing”. For example most people, know Paul Bunyan from Kenton, but the Dancin Bare strip club sign was equally iconic and more of a locals-only reference. Similarly, as much as I love the St John’s, what else is well known in St John’s that’s not the bridge?  I’d love to know more about some of yours.

I’m open to all Portland neighborhoods but there are a few I’d really like: St John’s, Overlook, Montavilla, Hollywood, Cully. Open to any others as well.  Thank you!",47,Portland

But I may have overreacted.,630,1757773780.0,"I grew up in places where stores had bulletproof glass and supermarkets had people stopping you from exiting without signing off on your receipt. You know, they often wear a vest (sometimes they're third-party security while other times, they're hourly workers). Where I grew up, they were aggressive towards people who meet a certain profile - and let's just say that profile is people who look like me.

So when I discovered more places in Portland were implementing a ""Receipt Checker"", I rightfully got frustrated. I don't want to be treated like a criminal. And I was seeing them everywhere. Fred Meyers, Ross, even a thrift store.

After a full year, I'd say these receipt checkers are alright. Many times, it's been really pleasant. One guy showed me his marker collection. One made a funny comment about my donuts. One really tough-looking gal drew cat faces on my reciept.

I still think they shouldn't exist. And maybe the stores wish they didn't either.  And maybe people on the Pacific Northwest don't have rent-a-cop energy with sticks up their butts, compared to where I used to live.

I may have overreacted to the Receipt Checkers out there. Thanks for making it a tolerable experience.",518,Portland

1nftqun,holocene portland why you do this to me,0,1757757972.0,"I went to Holocene tonight. The music was great but what broke me was this one girl.

She looked like she walked straight out of a movie, 500 Days of Summer type of scene. We danced near each other for a while, not caring about anyone else. She danced without trying, just being herself, light but not too light. Beautiful in a way that words don’t reach.

For a moment the world felt unreal. And then I remembered I’ll never have her. I’m not from here. I’m leaving soon, back to the other side of the world, Asia, my country. She made me lose hope in the rest of my life because I know I’ll never meet her again.

She wore a flower dress tonight. And I’m just a sensitive artist from the so-called third world. All I want is for this message to somehow reach her, to let her know how much I wanted her. If it were possible I wouldn’t go back. If it were possible I’d even ask her to marry me.

I know this sounds absurd. Maybe it is. But I had to write it down.

And yeah, I know this is a long shot. But hey, nobody here knows who I am, and she probably doesn’t even remember my face. Life already feels absurd because of her. What do I have left to lose lol.

Looking for a furry friend? Cedar and Lilac the kittens are taking adoption applications!

 Cedar is a friendly, playful, beautiful black, 10-week-old kitten. He loves looking out the window, scratches behind his head, and playing with feather toys. He would do well in a home with other cats, potentially dogs if slowly introduced, and older kids or younger pet knowledgeable kids or no children and indoor ONLY. He is especially interested in your application as he's gotten no interest yet :( 

Lilac is a shy and loving 10-week-old kitten. She purrs as soon as you pet her! She would do well in a home with other cats, very calm dogs in slowly introduced, and no / older children, indoor ONLY. She is slow to warm up and needs someone patient and compassionate to let her true colors show. 

The kittens were found lethargic and flea ridden. We were able to get them to the vet and get rid of the fleas and get them used to humans. They have made so much progress and are ready to find their furever home. 

To apply, please comment below or message me so we can give you the application link and answer any questions.

1neimrh,TIL: Portland Police Can Refer A Case To Restorative Justice Services Instead of Arresting Someone,62,1757620124.0,"Just learned that in Portland we have something called the Portland Community Justice Partnership. In short this is a relatively new program where the police can refer cases to a nonprofit who provides restorative justice services instead of arresting someone. The police are supposed to offer this option to people when they arrive on a scene but it sounds like they often aren't. However, anyone involved in a crime can ask for it, whether they're the perpetrator or the victim. If you're a crime victim you can even ask for it when you call the police to report what happened.

It's not available for certain very serious crimes like murder, rape, domestic violence, etc. But it sounds like they've had some good success so far with things like theft, hit and runs, and the like.

Both parties (perp and victim) have to agree to go this route before the case will be handed off to the nonprofit. If the person who committed the crime actively participates in the restorative justice process including effectively repairing with the victim they won't be arrested and won't have charges filed against them. But if they agree to participate and refuse to meaningfully engage, the case goes back to the police AND the DA has agreed to pursue charges against folks who get booted from the program.

Just wanted to spread the word about this because I had never heard of it and I think most other people haven't either! This post is pretty much all I know about it but you can check out their website [HERE](https://lcsnw.org/program/portland-community-justice/) or send any questions to rj@lcsnw.org or 971-888-7829. There are also volunteer opportunities available if anyone's interested, and they also offer non-crime related restorative justice services for a fee (sounds like this could be good for things like neighbor disputes over parking or a barking dog or something if both parties are willing to participate). But mostly, if you find yourself involved in a not super serious crime, be aware that you can ask for this!",18,Portland

1nega9u,Tabor Dance is a peace rally,1228,1757614711.0,"Mother Teresa said, ""I will never attend an anti-war rally; if you have a peace rally, invite me.""

Tabor Dance is a peace rally. It's where strangers can come together to share goodwill, positive energy, and joyful community. It's the world these locals want to live in, the world they promote with their presence.

The event looks like the scene at the end of The Grinch, where the town might be afflicted, yet the people came together in song and celebration. 

There are forces in this world that would like to see us divided, that thrive in making neighbors turn against each other. Our city needs peace rallies now more than ever. Tabor Dance is a frame of reference for what the world could be!

I know that stopping for pedestrians mid-block (not at a crosswalk) is fairly common here and not elsewhere (I learned this when I tried to stop for a pedestrian in another state and they seemed genuinely annoyed at me!) The other one I'm amused by is the polite and unspoken agreement to pull to the side to let another car pass first when there are cars parked on both sides (thus turning a two lane street into a tight fit). Obviously this is in our self interest - no one wants to damage their own or another's vehicle-but I can't imagine drivers in, say, Boston or Philly taking the time to self monitor the traffic flow. Are we just babies about tight spaces? Is this common road etiquette elsewhere and I just need to get out more? Just curious! ",384,Portland

1nd59q7,Reward: Lost Stuffed Bear (Update 1),37,1757480161.0,"Hello everyone, thank you for the incredibly kind outpouring following my post the other night. It has been a silver lining in an otherwise tough few days.

Unfortunately the bear has still not been found, and my partner is taking it very hard. She has not been eating or sleeping much the last few days, even crying so much she has begun to feel ill. The nice comments have been the only thing to make her smile so thank you again.

As for the hotel, it has continued to be very frustrating. As I wrote in a comment on one of the posts, I called the hotel yesterday where an employee told me that they knew where the bear was but I had to wait to hear from the housekeeping manager. I then called again where a second employee told me that they had found two bears in the room but had to wait several more hours to talk to the housekeeping manager who told me that they had not found any bears but that she was going to eventually send in someone to take the bed apart and look around.

I did not receive a call today, and when I called the housekeeping manager she did not call back. I called the hotel itself, only to be told that I can no longer talk to them and must go through the housekeeping manager.

I did email the corporate support line a few days ago, the response I got was they would basically tear the room apart to look for the bear, but they did not provide a timeline of when that would happen and I have not heard back.

It feels silly being so impacted by something like this with everything going on in the world, but this has really knocked us for a loop. My partner is truly devastated and I have spent multiple days with a pit in my stomach. All of this is made worse by the very real indifference we have felt from the hotel staff.

Once again, thank you for the kind words. I know many of you have said you don’t want/need the reward, but my partner and I are desperate and are upping it to $1000 in the hopes that does something.

As a bit of a numismatist, I’ve been scouring the PLANET for these bills for the past ten years. Recently went to visit an old friend and popped into a coin shop and saw a bunch of literature about DB Cooper. 

I came back the next morning and had a really good conversation with the guy that owned the place and told him that I’d looked in auctions—I had had Google notifications on in case anyone ever saw one of these bills or a photo even hit the internet. I just wanted to see one in person!

He’s like, I have all of them….

He’s asked me not to share location but he priced them out for me. I’m trying to repatriate at least one to the PNW. 

The only ones he doesn’t own are owned by the kid that found them—I believe he kept five and may have auctioned them off later. 

I got to take a photo with the three most complete bills. The cheapest is 5K and only a single round seal from one of the dilapidated bills without even a serial.

We are leaving this info here hoping that someone from the area can do something. It looks like the bird will be there in the weekend as the guy is always there.

Previous update: We wrote a message to the Bird Alliance of Oregon and they replied saying they don't have the resources and to call the Oregon Dept of Fish and WIldlife at 503 621 3488 or the Multnomah County Animal Services 503 988 7387.

We only have a data plan on our tourist e-sim and can't make phone calls to call some animal protection number.

We explained we want to let some bird or animal protection know but can't make phone calls and they didn't offer to help in any way and just said ""do what you have to do"" and went away.

1nbvpg6,"So I'm at New Seasons yesterday, and...",999,1757356095.0,"Yesterday, I took the kiddo out to run some weekend errands.  We washed the car and got lunch, and needed to hit the grocery store for some dinner supplies and to drop off some green bags.  I dropped into the New Seasons on NE Broadway or Weidler or whatever the road is up there by the Freddy's.  We buy our food and then head down the ramp to drop off our recycling.

As I'm pulling up, I see the door is open and there's a dude reaching inside.  My first thought is this guy is trying to steal someone's cans but he's wearing like Hokas and like Brooks Brothers khaki shorts or something so I quickly dismiss that notion.  But still, I can hear cans and bottles rattling around.  I park and let the little guy out of the car seat, and open the trunk to get my bags, and by the time I'm ready to take em over the guy is like IN the bottle drop.  All I see now is one foot kinda wiggling against the door like he was getting swallowed up by a time warp or a big whale or something.  The kiddo is like ""Ummmm, daddy?"" and I'm also like ""Uhhhh..."" and then the foot disappears and the door slams shut.  ""Brooks"" has been eaten by the bottle drop and I'm really not sure how to proceed.

So, after some quick reflection I decided the dude probably needs help and also I'm way too curious at this point to take the bottles somewhere else.  Plus, the kiddo is out of the car seat and getting him back in is a whole thing so I'm like ""OK, let's see where this goes.""  I scan my card and open the door and there's this dude just standing in there.  I say ""Hi there.  Um, what's up?"" or some dumb thing like that and he tells me he was trying to get a sticker on a bag he'd just tossed in but now he's stuck and the door in there is locked from the outside (for obvious reasons, I think).  I tell him, ""OK, I'll head into the store and get someone to come down to help"".

The kiddo and I walk up the ramp and he's like PUMPED.  Neither of us have ever seen anything like this and we both think it's pretty funny but also super weird, like honestly WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.  We go inside and I find the person working the self-checkout and tell them what's up.  I'm like ""so, I just saw a dude get swallowed up by the bottle drop downstairs"" and they look at me and they're like ""....coooooool...""  I tell them they look ""normal"", like, aside from the fact that they're inside the bottle drop deposit and locked in, but not like, you know, ""weird"".  And they're like ""...coooooool..."" again but then they're like ""OK, let me try to figure out who to talk to to go help out."".

So me and the buddy go downstairs again and back around to the bottle drop because obviously we need to see where this goes and also I still want to drop these bags off but probably not when there's some dude trapped in there or it's a vortex or something.  We get to the spot and an employee in an apron comes out the regular door - you know, the door authorized people are supposed to use to go in and out of the bottle drop - and he shrugs at me and says ""there's nobody in there.""

And I'm thinking WHAT.  I tell him ""OK, but I totally saw a dude crawl in through the door and get swallowed up in there and the employee is like ""oh, I know, I know, I watched him do it!  we all did."" and he points to a camera on the ceiling inside the door.  Then he proceeds to check inside the big blue bins in there, like the ones you'd drag out to the street that would definitely be big enough to hide a full grown person in.  He opens them both slowly like its a jack-in-the-box.  

THEY'RE BOTH EMPTY.  

The man has disappeared.

I have just returned from a vacation around the Pacific Northwest. This past Thursday, 9/4, my girlfriend and I stayed at the Kimpton Vintage Portland room 606. We were in a rush in the morning and unfortunately lost her stuffed bear, a substantially sentimental item from her grandmother. She has been beside herself with panic attacks and frankly, the hotel has not been the most responsive, consistently only looking at a webpage to see if the bear has been “logged.” 

We are certain the bear is either behind/under the bed or in the laundry. We are offering a $750 reward (in addition to expedited shipping) for the return of the bear. Please… help us.

When they were weaned we took them in and got them fixed and vaccinated through feral cat coalition last week. We have two cats already so would love to find them some new homes. They are all still a little nervous with humans so would need a new owner with the patience to keep working on socializing but we’ve seen them grow so much already and are confident they will one day be great companions. I can get most of them to purr while being pet and two will allow being held and getting pet in my lap. Please reach out to me if interested and we can set up a time to meet them.

There is one female grey tabby, two brown tabbies one male and female and one black female. It would be awesome if anyone wanted to take two as kittens often do better together. All have been fixed and vaccinated, but were too young for rabies vaccine. We think they are about 12 weeks. They all have a little clip in their ear that’s not visible in photos from when fcc did the procedure. It’s hardly noticeable but happy to send updated pics. I live in east Portland area. 

I have an appointment yo give them to pixie project at the start of next month if I don’t find them homes between now and then. And if the two more skiddish ones don’t socialize more and meet their criteria they will go to the humane society and hopefully become barn cats.

These roads and the roads they feed are fully capable of handling 2 lanes of traffic,  in fact it moved traffic more efficiently,  now I’m waiting through 3 and 4 traffic signal cycles just to move 1/4 mile

Now each light cycle only permits 4-5 cars to cross 82nd at a time, that road feeds I205!  Wtf would they restrict outflow to a highway?!

Due to the paw-sitive (haha) response from the last dog I highlighted, I want to do another.

Yesterday, my husband and I went and looked at [Reggie](https://www.petfinder.com/dog/reggie-mcas-77633110/or/troutdale/multnomah-county-animal-services-or57/). He is an 80lb bundle of love! We took him out in the yard to play with him, and the person showing him to us said he's being overlooked due to skin allergies. He is the happiest boy with a goofy personality! They said he was found as a stray, but seemed to be well socialized around people and other dogs. He will need medicated baths regularly and possibly a special diet to help with his skin, but otherwise he would make a perfect dog for a family!

Again, I do not work at or volunteer at this shelter. I am just trying to help dogs get adopted :)

Until now a friend and I have been taking care of him, but the issue is we both have other pets that are the one-dog-per-house type, and it is seeming like Buddy may lean that way too. 

He’s had a really rough life, but he’s such a good boy. He has settled down a lot and gotten more used to living the good life. He needs someone who wants only one dog, is patient, willing to work on training, and has a lifestyle that fits with his high energy and brute strength. 

Ideally someone that can bring him along to work or wfh, and someone active themselves who takes him adventuring with them. 

He’s good at dog parks, too much for cats, very loyal, very attentive, and very snuggly. 

All rescue places are filled to the brim so now I am left wondering…can the magic of Reddit help me find Buddy’s soul mate? In another world, where I didn’t already have a zoo, I would absolutely keep him myself. He is such a joy to be around.

I've been unsuccessful in finding him a new home and it's starting to take a toll on everyone in the home-him, my cat, and myself. The situation is becoming more dire and I'm looking to rehome him as soon as possible.
We're on the waiting list for the Humane Society, but the wait could still be another couple of months. It breaks my heart to see how this living situation is impacting both of them and it's kicking my mental health's ass.
Thanks for reading.

I'll paste the original post's text below:

“Last Christmas I brought home a rabbit for my roommate and I. We were like platonic dads to this little guy and we both love him dearly.

He and I had to part ways from our living situation (a slumlord slapping bandaids on gaping wounds, we couldn’t stay any longer) and we both had to downsize—him to a studio, me to a one bedroom with myself, my rabbit, and a cat.

Our rabbit went from having his own bedroom, a whole upstairs floor of a house, and a backyard to a large cage with limited time to free roam. I work too much and don’t feel comfortable leaving him out alone with our cat (as docile, old, and chonk as he may be).

Ultimately it’s become apparent that my sweet boy’s quality of life has taken a hit and he deserves much better. I’m stressed out knowing that I’m unable to provide him with the care, space, and attention he needs.

I’m looking to rehome him with someone who has more space and either the time or people around to pay him as much attention as he needs. Ideally someone with a yard, but if not then plenty of space to roam. He comes with a large cage (if you’d like), a litter box, potty pads, some bedding, a big bag of hay, and tons of pellets/additives and treats. I can provide nail clippers as well. I’d prefer that someone with experience with caring for small animals takes him, but if not that’s okay too—I can provide you with as much information as possible.

He’s just over a year old and has not yet been neutered. It was first on the list of priorities once my finances recover from the move, but I’ve been in the new place for less than a month and I’m unfortunately not there yet. Other than that he’s perfectly healthy and full of love and life.

Please go easy on me—this isn’t what I wanted by any means. My cat and I have both bonded with him, he’s my boy. I just want to see that he goes to the right home. Having to rehome him is devastating and whoever gets this wild little spirit is lucky.”",18,Portland

1n7zs9n,Mr. Blue needs a home. Let it be yours!,253,1756957203.0,"Meet Mr. Blue. He's an extremely sweet gray cat who absolutely loves attention. He previously lived in a 300 sqft home (room, really) with 2 other cats, which caused him immense stress to the point where he was urinating outside of the litter box.

Mr. Blue was dropped off voluntarily at a vet for euthanization due to his 'inappropriate urination'. The owner dropped him off, told the vet the situation, then left.

I found out about this quickly and called the vet to arrange to take him in instead of letting him die. The vet tech I talked to told me that she was going to take him in, monitor his habits, then set him up for adoption.

She's had him for a few weeks, and Mr. Blue has not peed outside of his litter box at all. We both think that the previous living situation (300sqft, multiple cats, etc) was stressing him out to the breaking point. Taking him out of that situation seems to have completely remedied that.

We think he's absolutely ready to live in a healthy environment as an only cat.

Mr. Blue is neutered. He's extremely sweet, is very playful, and loves getting attention. I would take him in myself, but I already have multiple cats and as I said before, he would most likely thrive in a situation as an only cat.

One last important note: Mr. Blue has had a urinary blockage in the past. He had to have surgery to correct it. He's fine now, but in order to prevent future urinary blockages, the vet recommends putting him on a urinary diet from now on. 

Please help me find Mr. Blue a new home!",18,Portland

The west side is better than the east side. Here’s why. Gullies, tall trees, and windy quiet streets through SW and the NW hills. Still pretty well served by transit considering how residential most of the west side is. The south waterfront is gorgeous to look at from afar or explore, and Terwilliger is one of the most beautiful places in the city to walk, run, or bike. The trails leading up toward OHSU and up to Fairmount Drive are wonderful as well. You have incredibly easy access to downtown from all of SW via Barbur, and from most of NW via Burnside/Skyline. Performing arts, shopping and dining, and a massive public university downtown. Gorgeous views back to downtown from both the West Hills and Kings Heights. Top notch neighborhood corridors like Multnomah Village, NW 23rd, and the Pearl. Amazing access to the river at Willamette park and several houseboat communities. Tryon Creek State Park. Two highly rated public high schools and many well regarded elementary and middle schools. While it may be easy to say that these are all things that require some degree of wealth to enjoy, the east side (west of ~50th) is comparably expensive to live in. The east side certainly has lots of desirable commercial strips, but who needs that many? The west side has a manageable amount of quality businesses. Also, it has a surprising amount of diversity if you know where to look (but unfortunately admittedly less than the east side). I love all of Portland. But the west side is the best side.

Public art projects are powerful ways to encourage community investment.

Some quotes from the painting neighbors:

""Project-based action is how we get to know each other a little bit more than just saying Hi.""

""You get to break barriers to connecting with people from so many different backgrounds. This is proof that we can work together, and this does not have to be an isolated event.""

""It's a rare moment of community in the current age.""

**MY RECENT THOUGHTS ON MAXIMIZING IMPACT:**

\---> ***TOH MUST BE REMOVED SAFELY & WITH PROPER TECHNIQUE.***

* Folks are unclear on PPE, herbicide types, and technique, and can easily hurt themselves, others, or the natural environment, especially using Triclopyr. Glyphosate is safer for several reasons, go read all about it... TLDR: use only [this](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/compare-n-save-concentrate-grass-and-weed-killer-41-glyphosate-1118710) & read the label (!!!), wear long sleeves, pants, closed-toe footwear, latex gloves, and apply the minimum amount necessary in late summer/early fall (now!).
* Chopping down TOH makes it grow back stronger. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKLW2TXS1jg) is a good intro (Penn State U Extension)

**1- Nonviolent and extremely boring**

And more importantly 

**2- Unusable for propaganda**

The first has been discussed ad nasueam so we don't need to keep going over it in this thread.

But for B, it is critical that everyone, and I mean EVERYONE keep the messaging simple:

""Trump knew Epstein, Trump diddles children, Release the files""

Pictures of Trump + Epstein, Pictures of Trump's signature on the birthday cards, etc.

Business owners put the pictures of Epstein and Trump on your storefronts/signage/billboards. 

Trump wants to occupy your city with the military, counter this by occupying your city with what he *really* doesn't want, more focus on the fact he is a pedophile.

----

Another important factor in this, don't dress in black and red and look like the pictures they are displaying on Fox News.

Wear regular, boring, mundane clothing that will make all the video they get uninteresting and relatable to anyone across the US. Their goal is to rile up their base and further the divide, related to the rest of the US.

And I hate to say this, but don't be weird, be boring until they go away. The troops are not your enemy either here, treat them well, shit treat them better than they are getting treated by their bosses. Bring them water bottles, take fun pictures with them (bonus points for holding up pics of Epstein), and generally welcome them.

1ns8pdv,Repost of Inspiring Text from /r/portland in 2020 - Wish I knew what user to credit them,1,1759013437.0,"Portland is nestled between two rivers, spilling out from the confluence of the Columbia and the Willamette (rhymes with ‘dammit‘) at the northernmost reach of a fertile valley, eighty miles from the Pacific and eighty miles from Mt. Hood, bounded by low hills and farmland, circled by freeways, thirty feet about sea level, dressed in mist and rain and roses, suffused with pine trees and hazels, cedars, maples and oaks, buckled over by bridges, built on the land of the Chinook peoples, the Multnomah and the Clackamas and the Cowlitz tribes.  It was named by two coin flips; had chance gone the other way, I’d be writing an essay about Boston, Oregon.  It was called Stumptown because during its first explosive growth the trees were leveled for lumber and for space, and people hopped from stump to stump to avoid the muck of the nascent roads.  It’s called Bridgetown, the spans over the Willamette throbbing with cars, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, a list Homeric, from the Sellwood and Ross Island at the south end of the city through the Tillikum Crossing, the Marquam, the Hawthorne and Morrison and Burnside, the Steel and Broadway trusses, the high arches of the Fremont, then the Burlington Northern railway bridge and the St. Johns suspension.  We are the City of Roses.  We are Rip City.  We are stuffed full of bookstores, dotted with marijuana dispensaries, a city replete with strip clubs, microbrews and coffee mingling in our bloodstream, a city where the Trail Blazers play, and the Thorns and Timbers, but also where there’s a thriving roller derby league, adult kickball competitions, axe-throwing and cornhole and a soapbox derby combining engineering and alcoholism, careening down the slopes of a volcano every summer in a hop-scented haze.

Portland’s history is colorful, filled with mobsters and whores, gambling and press-ganging, bordellos floating on houseboats on the Willamette, smuggling tunnels under the downtown streets, barroom ghosts and train robbers.  

But Portland’s history is also a history of white supremacy and racism, of intolerance, bigotry and slaughter.  In 1940 Oregon--the whole STATE of Oregon--had fewer than 1,800 Black people in it.  And then during the war Portland’s shipyards fired up, and Blacks came to town to build weapons.  By 1946 there were 15,000 Black people in Portland, most of them concentrated in one area, a place known as Vanport, located at an elevation about fifteen feet below the Columbia River.  After the war, the mayor of Portland said in a newspaper article that, frankly, Blacks were no longer welcome.  And then, in 1948, on Memorial Day, during a period of heavy, sustained rain, a berm broke.  Vanport flooded.  Those Blacks who had come to Portland, probably the whitest city in America, lost their homes and livelihoods.  It wasn’t until 1959 that Oregon ratified the 15th Amendment, giving Blacks the right to vote.  In 1981--when I was twelve--a couple of Portland cops tossed four dead possums onto the entryway of a Black-owned hamburger joint.  In 1988--the year after I graduated high school, in a class with exactly zero African-American students--an Ethiopian student here in Portland named Mulugeta Seraw was beaten to death, by white supremacists, with a baseball bat ‘because (as one of the murderers said) of his race’.  We’ve had Klan mayors, and Klan police chiefs, and Klan businessmen.



Portland is beautiful.  I choke up sometimes, crossing the Ross Island Bridge as the sun sets over the West Hills, at how beautiful the city is, limned in evening radiance and bespeckled with the lights in the downtown windows, the slow peaceful parade of cars, the twinkle of the radio towers.  But I never, ever forget that the foundations of the Rose City are built on concrete concocted with innocent blood.  And when the Proud Boys and the boogaloo assholes and the trump brownshirts come rumbling into town in their four-bys, togged out in camo and hefting military-grade armaments in the beds, firing paintballs and pepper spray at protestors while the cops take a powder and a long smoke break, it doesn’t surprise me.  In Portland, it was ever thus.

But for all of that--Portland also has another nickname.  It was given to us by the Secret Service under George H.W. Bush, who really, really hated it whenever they had to come here to provide security for him or Vice President Quayle.  Racist and exclusionary as Portland’s history has been, we’re also the home of Reed College, one of the most liberal activist hotbeds in the country.  For all our dearth of Black people, we can gin up a BLM protest with a thousand participants at the drop of a hat.  Occupy Wall Street was huge, here.  Our Pride parades are amazing.  The city may be a house built by racists, with the bones of dead minorities, but living in that house are humans who want to tear all that shit down and build a BETTER home, a home rising from the bedrock of equality and justice and compassion, humans who wake up every morning and whose first thoughts are of destroying the patriarchy, the oligarchy, the creaking lumbering capitalistic automaton that seeks to keep us all low, ignorant, poor, and enslaved.  And Portland protests.

BOY does Portland protest.

That’s why the Bush people called us ‘Little Beirut’.  They’d fly here with Dan Quayle to have a thousand-dollar-a-plate lunch with the Republican Businessmen’s Coalition at the Multnomah Athletic Club, and there’d be five hundred psychos in tie-dyed shirts thronging the street outside, playing Neil Young’s ‘Ohio’ and Buffalo Springfield‘s ‘For What It‘s Worth‘, smoking pot and chanting.  Once a group of protestors chugged a bunch of food-colored liquid, then lined up in front of the Vice President’s hotel and, on cue, puked out huge vomitous puddles of red, white and blue onto the pavement.  Currently, we’ve got protestors with lacrosse rackets catching tear gas canisters and lobbing them back at the cops, we’ve got dads with leaf blowers clearing the air, and hippies with bundles of burning sage sweetening it.  We had a Wall of Moms, we had the naked yoga Athena, we’ve got volunteers feeding the masses, impromptu ambulances and medics dealing with burning eyes and rubber-bullet contusions, and we have, all over the city, Black Lives Matter signs on telephone poles, children playing while their parents sit on lawn chairs next to busy thoroughfares holding up Breonna Taylor placards, we have movie theater marquees with ACAB across them, and restaurants and boutiques with solidarity messages in the windows.

“Tin soldiers and Nixon coming” sang Neil Young.  Now the tin soldiers are federal troops in camouflage, without name tags or identifying marks, and Nixon has been replaced by trump, but the threat is the same, and the stakes higher.

Portland isn’t perfect.  But, for what’s happening now, in this country, at this time, when every Democratic principle has been laid down on the table waiting for the roll of the dice, we may be the best hope America has.  We have our Klan, our Proud Boys, our white supremacists and racists and xenophobes and capitalists--but we also have a hard, steel core of true patriots willing to stand, to fight, and to die for justice.

trump wants to make an example of Portland.  We are his Carthage.  He wants to ride in here, tear the city down to its bedrock, then seed the ground with salt.  We are going to be his Reichstag fire, his USS Maine, his casus belli, his Sudetenland.

And he may win.  I don’t know what the future holds.  But I do know this city, this frustrating, marvelous, horrible, magical city.  And I know this as well--trump better bring a fucking lunch.

Maybe everybody here can follow suit.  The Klingons occupied the Organian planet and they ignored them.  Kirk tried to organize a resistance but nobody wanted to help.  They didn’t need to fight back because they were highly evolved beings.

It is with heavy heart I find news of your ongoing war. Cocking my ear, I do believe I hear the faint ringing of mortar shells...yes, indeed I do. They ring out like the pangs of my heart, knowing each explosion may well be the final cry of a life.

Lest you grow weary, digging into the trenches; battening down the hatches; visiting Whole Foods; know that the rest of us Yankees have now heard the news. Take strength in the knowledge that reinforcements will soon arrive! Poppy - my 6 month old French Bulldog - knows that what was once a vacation has now turned into a war campaign. Her poison gas...truly rotten, lung melting gas...will be a gruesome but welcome ally on the fields of battle.

Though the rivers may run red with blood as screams sound out in a cacophony of death, though the bombs and tanks may rumble the very Earth. Hold! Hold, for the Orange Fuhrer has seen your cause and will save you!

I caught a show at the Hollywood theatre and enjoyed some dumplings at Hawthorne Asylum. Even though it rained the whole time I had an awesome experience. 

I think my point is that Portland is a truly fascinating city filled with great people and culture (and coffee). I would love to return one day (feel free to drop recommendations for my next visit).

I can envision pushback from some about my idea and discuss it later in the post. But I do think my idea has a place. 

The French resistance during WWII used similar tactics to confuse their opponents and influence public perception about the realities of the war. 

My idea would include white women cosplaying very much in the trad-wife aesthetic portraying Portland as a 1950s MAGA Christian dreamland. 

(Cute pastel dresses, curled hair, Fox News make up, collecting flowers, browsing markets, and tearfully crying out about occupation by troops and how scary it is—questioning why they are here when it’s such a peaceful place. (It IS a peaceful place, this is not a lie.) 

I can even imaging a freedom-of-religion narrative, how we’ve been able to express our Christian values here free of persecution .  (I am in fact atheist).

I’d work with a few psychologists to come up with natural scripts that cause dissonance that targets the MAGA own-the-lib and destroy-sanctuary-cities thinking. And we can flood Facebook, X, truth social, instagram, and tik tok with video content. 

The pushback I can imagine is that this is a classiest or racist response of a privileged white person and that this is not the proper way to fight fascism. 

The thing is, we know that Trump / Miller are trying to escalate things to stir up violence and fulfill their prophecy that Portland IS in fact a war ravaged city. This also protects black and trans people from being identified and lets them rest, stay home! 

If anyone is interested in discussing my vision, please reply and I’ll set up a server to discuss.

1nranq9,"Recycle your old tech and browse no to low cost electronics at Free Geek’s Pop-up! Saturday, September 27th from 11AM - 4PM at 1731 SE 10th ave.",66,1758915155.0,"**What is Free Geek?**  
Free Geek is a Portland based non-profit founded on Earth Day, 2000. Our mission is to sustainably reuse technology, enable digital access, and provide education to create a community that empowers people to realize their potential.

Free Geek’s goal is to divert technology that would otherwise be thrown away, refurbish it, and give it back to our community at no or low cost. What cannot be refurbished is recycled in an environmentally responsible manner. Since 2000, we have diverted 27,000,000+ lbs of e-waste from landfills, and granted 75,000+ devices back to the community.

**What technology do you take?**

Free Geek accepts nearly everything that plugs in or uses electricity, including computers, smartphones, tablets, printers, TVs, Audio/video systems, related accessories, and much more. We are also a proud participant of the Oregon E-Cycles program, which guarantees convenient recycling of computers, monitors, TVs, printers, keyboards, and mice for Oregonians and many small businesses.

While we do take most electronics, there are some things we don’t accept: [https://www.freegeek.org/small-donation#what-we-dont-accept](https://www.freegeek.org/small-donation#what-we-dont-accept)

We don’t require a fee for our recycling service, but we do invite donors to consider making an optional monetary donation to support our work toward bridging the digital divide in our community.

**What happened to the Free Geek Thrift Store?**  
Like most small businesses, Free Geek was impacted by the COVID pandemic. This forced us to shut down our brick and mortar thrift store and we have not re-opened since. With regular pop-up shops we hope to re-engage with the community and inch back towards opening our thrift store again.

Free Geek’s online store is still available at: [https://www.ebay.com/str/freegeekportland](https://www.ebay.com/str/freegeekportland) and we offer free local pickup for all orders.

**What is available at the pop-up shop?**  
The pop-up shop will have a selection of low to no cost refurbished computers, phones, and monitors. In addition to vintage tech, retro gaming consoles, and niche accessories that span generations of tech innovation. We also provide free essentials like cables, power banks, power cords, and computer accessories. Every purchase at Free Geek’s pop-up shop supports our mission to bridge the digital divide.

**Can I use my store credit?**  
Yes! If you have store credit from our old thrift store, you can bring it by and we’ll apply the credit to your purchase.

**Can I return items bought at the Free Geek pop-up shop?**  
All sales at the pop-up shop are final. If something is defective or not working, bring it back to our next pop-up shop for an exchange. We do not offer refunds.",4,Portland

On one hand, I've been seeing more open drug use, often multiple times a day, folks huddled around trash fires next to decrepit RVs, and folks sleeping/passed out on the streets. It felt like things were getting better in late spring, but in the past few weeks, things have felt as bad as I've ever seen. The electric fence around the old Dollar Tree & associated parking lot on Lombard also seems to elevate the dystopian prison vibes as I get word of parents being detained by ICE. 

On the other hand, I've been enjoying the bike lane improvements around North Portland, the TASS sites and shelters appear to be helping people, and some local business owners seem hopeful for the future. I love seeing the Timbers and Thorns stadiums as full as they are, and biking to watch the away games with the community at Chill&Fill fills my heart.  

I'm not on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Nextdoor, etc... so I might be more reliant on conversations with neighbors and the North Peninsula Review to develop my take on things than I should be, and I'm wary of my echo chamber's bias. 

I guess my questions for folks here are:

* How do you feel about Portland's future? 
* What projects or plans make you roll your eyes?
* Which ones make you deeply nervous about your ability or willingness to stay here?
* Which ones give you glimmers of hope that things will get better?
* Is the MLB coming to Portland a pipedream? a scam? The thing that will gentrify Portland, making it even less affordable?
* How much of your feelings about Portland are based on decisions being made at the federal level versus locally driven?

1nsqvpb,"Portland 2020: What I saw during the ""Fed Wars""",0,1759072526.0,"With the news that President Trump intends to send troops to Portland, it feels like a good time to revisit the last time he sent federal officers to “save” and “protect” “war-ravaged Portland.”

It’s been more than five years since I landed in Portland, Oregon amidst what would become known as the “Fed Wars.”   
  
For more than a week, thousands gathered nightly downtown. Families, veterans, young people, elders — the city’s cross-section filled the streets.   
  
Protests that began focused on police brutality and racial injustice evolved to include defiance of federal forces in their city, ostensibly, to guard federal property.

What I witnessed was a stunning amount of violence: tear gas — a chemical weapon banned in warfare — used liberally on crowds; protesters pulled into unmarked vans; medics, journalists, and legal observers attacked; and the indiscriminate firing of so-called “less-lethal” munitions. (it was a Federal officer who shot me with a rubber bullet)

What will happen in Portland now is unclear, as the President did not offer specifics and we’re left to decipher such utterances as: “We’re going to get out there and we’re going to do a pretty big number on those people in Portland.”

But what is clear is that this isn’t about “crime” or “order” — it’s a page out of the authoritarian playbook: eroding norms, bypassing legal guardrails, and treating dissent as an existential threat.

I just rescued a dog yesterday and it happened very quickly. I’ve been looking for a while but wasn’t expecting it to happen that day. Anyways, he is a super sweet, 3 year old mini poodle mix. I’ve never rescued before, I’ve only had experience with my parents’ dogs from breeders so this is very new to me. I want to train him using positive reinforcement for sure. I do think he was abused—he’s very skiddish and if he comes up to me, I gently and slowly put my hand out for him to sniff and he winces like I’m going to hit him. It makes me so sad. I only engage if he shows me he wants me to.

I’m showing him love on his terms, patience and giving him treats to encourage him (which he unfortunately rarely takes at the moment). I know it will take time for him to decompress, feel comfortable, and feel at home, but since I’ve never rescued a dog before, I want to make sure I’m doing all the right things and not traumatizing him in any way. He’s had quite a few accidents in the house despite walks. I live in an apartment complex with a small patio. I did get a grass pad for him but he still hasn’t figured out it’s for going potty and not laying down lol. I do have a crate set up for him and keep the door open if he wants to go in it and he has a few times.

I do work full time and am planning on getting a dog walker for him initially and then once he feels more comfortable, I would like to bring him to a doggie daycare. Does anyone have any recommendations for the following:
1. Training including crate training and potty training
2. Dog walker
3. Doggie daycare

I’m moving out of my apt by EOD Tuesday and desperate to sell a nice couch (from Costco) by EOD Monday (cleaning Tuesday). I haven’t had any bites on Craigslist for a month, can’t go on FB/have a profile due to safety concerns.

Neighbors aren’t interested unfortunately. 

I’m selling it for rather cheap (as in, a $4-500 loss) bc I *need* someone to buy it. The economy sucks, I know. TBH I’d go even lower at this point just to get it the hell out of my apt.

I'm coming from Medford, OR, and I've been daydreaming about walking in walkable neighborhoods/downtown areas, getting coffee etc... but I'm apartment searching on a budget. So I'm looking mostly at 1 bedrooms under $1300/mo.

Anyways, I've found a few options with some options in the NW/Alphabet district, a few just outside downtown lines next to PSU, and some that are in the Multnomah Village area. 

The best bang for my buck option I found is a 1bd 1bath apt 580sq/ft with 1 parking spot included for $1100/mo in the Multnomah Village area (10-15mins from downtown). After that there's apt options next to PSU just outside downtown lines for around $1200/mo with 500sq/ft and street permit parking. Last is NW/Alphabet district apartment options at $1300/mo to live in a smaller 400-500sq/ft apartment, but walkability is amazing. Street parking is more risky for break-ins here, though.

Anyways, is the walkable neighborhood in NW worth the extra $200/mo in costs? Or would it not feel like I miss anything from living a 10-minute drive away from downtown?

I 100% want my car, so I have to take into account parking costs. Would a middle-ground location, like being close to PSU, but not directly in a walkable neighborhood, be a good option? I also work 100% remote, which is why the size of the apt is a concern for me.

I get that I can only know what I really want for myself, but I want your opinions on how you feel about that trade-off personally. I mean, what I really want is to be able to afford a 1 bd at $1500-1600/mo & apt parking costs in NW or Pearl area, but I'm a year off from that at the minimum.",36,askportland

I mentioned something offhand to my partner about it and he surprisingly said he's always loved the PNW and we should do it. That sparked a year-long conversation about logistics and timing, and whether we should actually uproot our lives here for a fresh start. We both own property and my career is location-specific so I'd lose a lot of what I've built by starting over in a new place. But life is about so much more than money and a job.

should say this is the first time I'd been to this theater!  i'd never been to any McMenamins property, and I didn't know anything about their history/marketing/mythology prior.

this is also the first time in my life i've ever had an experience with something that appeared to be a ghost.

\*\*

Just got home from the late showing of *One Battle After Another* (it's good - I recommend).  The showing started at 10:45 and this film has an almost 3 hour running time, so it was over around 2 a.m.  I went by myself and sat in the middle of the theater on the floor level.  I usually watch a film until the credits are totally over, so am typically the last person there.

But this time, as the credits rolled, I could hear floor sweeping that sounded like it was right behind me.

I kept watching the credits for a bit, but figured the person working there was trying to give me a hint, so I stood up to leave before the credits were done....

...and there was no one there.  No usher, nobody with a broom.  The sound of sweeping had also stopped.  My first thought was to ask an employee if the place was haunted, but I didn't see a single soul in the theater, nor in the lobby, as I walked out.

I guess it's possible that the acoustics could've just been crazy and maybe the usher was sweeping up in the balcony and it somehow sounded like it was a row or two directly behind me....but how?

\*\*

Googled it right away and the internet says the theater is widely considered to be haunted, and the most prominent spirit is a former maintenance person.

It didn't feel threatening or anything - I actually tried to talk to it a little as I stood there.  It seems spookier now that I'm home.

So I was wondering...anyone else have stories about running into McMenamins Bagdad ghosts?",25,askportland

I am seeking information of what folks who got their teaching degree in the Portland area/online ACTUALLY paid for their education. 

Did you receive grants, and if so how much?

Did a district help pay for your education if you were in a certain field (ie.SPED)?

Did those grants come with strings attached that you now find burdensome?

Were you paid for student teaching? (I have recently heard that some districts are paying their student teachers)

At the end of the day, what did the education cost you? Please specify if you already had an undergrad degree or not.

1nrijqc,Any advice on PGE overcharge?,5,1758936105.0,"I just got my electric bill for the month - it's 10x higher than my previous highest bill ever. Their website shows normal daily usage, but over 17000 kwh (17mwh) for the month. I didn't even use that much over the previous 12 months combined!

Any advice on dealing with PGE? I called and they told me to set up a payment plan.

Edit: This is not related to my solar installation. I can confirm without any doubt whatsoever there was NO solar generation before the meter swap on the 22nd, and that meter swap is why the billing cycle ended on the 21st.
The Enphase gateway was installed prior to the billing cycle, and the Enphase app clearly shows there was no power generated or exported during that month. It also clearly shows only 1.3mwh consumed for the month. And even if it was due to power being exported? They are charging me for more than a year of power in one month. My solar system is designed for LESS than that over an entire year. It's not going to do it a month.

This is not an issue with my electrical, not an issue with my solar, and if it was an issue with the meter it's too late to confirm because that meter is gone.

The question is solely about advice on dealing with PGE, because it's not caused by my actual power consumption.",21,askportland

Person applied for the HRSN grant in November 2024 and again in December 2024. 

Received a formal eviction notice January 7 2025. Was accepted for the grant on January 14 2025

Letter was sent stating I was accepted for 6 months of paid rent and 6 months of utilities. 

Lawyers officer and property management did not return phone calls or connect in any way by cure by date, in fact could not get ahold of them at all until court April 16. 

Told the judge and court that HRSN was promised, here is the letter from Care Oregon. 

They still did not pay. Persons heavily advocated through every avenue to get help, there was no help. 

Reached out to multiple organizations to help with rent, but they said they couldn’t help until the grant paid because the amount that is needed is too much to help with. 

Trial date was set for June 2nd 2025. Person could not afford an attorney. Person now owes 39,000$ in back rent to property management HRSN still didn’t pay, nor could there be help with.

Person was evicted from their home of 5 years on July 1st, and now owes more money than they make in a year. 

Person now has ruined credit, an eviction on their record, a repossessed car, and their name has been absolutely tarnished as well for something that they relied on the state to do. 

They have reached out to basically every free resource like:

OHA
Care Oregon
HRSN hold line for hours at a time, only to be hung up on.
Oregon state bar 
community alliance of tenants 
Oregon law center 
211
Clear clinic
Metropolitan Public Defenders 

But a lot of them have conflict of interest because it’s a program through OHP care Oregons they’ve been told. 

Any help yall have would be great, I’m just the messenger but I genuinely feel for this person and am wanting to help them the best I can.

My all time favorite coffee drink was the pumpkin pie latte. When the OG’s closed this past year I was sad mostly because of losing the drink but was happy to see them survive via a new owner.

1npm4ws,Tips for visiting at the end of the year?,0,1758743479.0,"Hi! My wife and I are planning on visiting Portland between Christmas and New Years to do a little neighborhood scouting, as we are hoping to move to your city next year. We stayed in Portland for a few days way back in 2015, and fell in love with the city. We’ve talked about moving there ever since, and are now in a position where we can pull the trigger.

Ideally we’d like to stay in a somewhat central neighborhood with good MAX access - I had thought Kerns but maybe closer to Downtown/the Pearl? We won’t have a car and want to get around as much as possible using public transit. 

The plan is basically to spend a day in each quadrant (sextant?), eating, drinking, and doing as the locals do, but also to envision what it would really be like to live there full time. I’m compiling a list of places we’ll try to hit in each area, and attempt to cram in as much as we can over the 4 or 5 days we’ll be there. I know there’s no shortage of world-class restaurants and cool, unique shops, so the focus will be more on getting a vibe check for the neighborhoods, what commuting would look like, etc. 

How dead should we expect the city to be? I know things tend to slow down in that period between Christmas and New Years generally, but I don’t know how much that applies in Portland specifically. Do a lot of smaller businesses close up shop? Does the city “empty out” noticeably as people go to visit family or stay in for a few days? As an example, we love pub trivia and would ideally be able to stop in somewhere to play one of the nights we’re in town — should we expect a lot of them to be off that week?

Any insights (or recommendations for places to check out!) would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",21,askportland

I'm 33, laid off software engineer and took a break from job-hunting for the summer to help my ND kiddo improves some skills before the school year started.

The coffee shop scene/gym scene/dog scene provides decent human stimulation, but wanted to put my schedule out there in case anyone has a similar schedule/priorities and wants to maybe have a coffee shop study buddy/movement gym buddy/walk our dogs or eat/cook lunch buddy?

I organize a meetup for former educators and teachers transitioning (or considering transitioning) into a new industry/career. This is something I do off the clock every 2 months or so - as a former teacher myself - to build community and help connect folks to each other, to resources, and share stories and opportunities. It’s a tough job market out there and for those who may have only worked in education or been in the industry for a long time, it can be a really difficult shift. 

I’m looking for a space on the east side and centrally-located where we can hold our October meetup. Somewhere where folks can gather open house style from 6-8pm on a Wednesday evening to connect over food/drink. 

This has proven tough because I have no budget as a solo organizer. Specifically, I need to find a place that: 
- allows me to reserve table space for about 15 people without a fee
- doesn’t have a food & beverage minimum
- allows people to just have their own tab
- is indoors, unless there’s a covered and heated patio.

Something came over me, however, and I convinced myself to go to a concert at the moda center next month. I’ve never attended a show at a venue this large and I have NO idea what to expect. For those of you who are seasoned pros, I’d love to hear from you! 

How early do you get there? How bad is the parking? Is it better to park elsewhere and get an uber to take you there? 

If the lines are long, is most of the waiting done outside? Just trying to plan in case the weather is bad. 

We know our section and row, but not the seat number. Is that assigned closer to the event date or do all the people assigned to that row just fight over who sits where?

I want to thank everyone here, not just Portlanders who answered my own posts, but to everyone on this subreddit for your suggestions that I searched through all week. I had an incredible time in your city, and in my travels Portland Oregon has been my favorite trip.

I took a day trip to the coast, went to Astoria, climbed the column, drove over the big bridge to the lighthouse at Cape Disappointment, I was not disappointed. I can only wish there was a shop with a bumper sticker that says ""I went to Cape Disappointment and everyone there knew you"". I went back over the bridge and ate salmon, then saw a shipwreck, then saw the sunset at cannon beach.

I saw the Zoo, which I want to say, some here said it wasn't that great but as someone who has visited zoos in every city your zoo is very special and has a wonderful layout. It is up there on my list with my current favorite the Knoxville Zoo, even beating out the Bronx Zoo for the wonderful section on the biodiversity of the PNW. I saw the Japanese Garden and wish I could go back a million times and experience it for the first time. I walk along the roses.

I ate food from around the world at local cart pods and drank local beer, and shopped at local book stores and talked to local people about local books. I saw one taxidermy shop and loved it so much I went to the other one across town. I took a trip downtown on the MAX and wished public transportation everywhere could be as convenient and easy to understand for a tourist and walked to the Chinese garden and drank hot tea and watched the Koi swim not knowing there was a whole city outside their little pond. 

I drank coffee and read books in coffee shops. I had the Spanish latte not once but twice at La Lucha and had Einspanner and a breakfast burrito at Fehrenbacher Hof. I sat in a very dark room at Jake's Crawfish and had crab cakes and more salmon. I shopped for more books and flipped through record bins. I played pinball in UV illuminated bars.

Most wonderful of all though was Robot Alley. I don't have any words to describe what I saw there. Only that I wish every neighborhood of the world had small pockets of curiosity as strange as this.

I saw so much, I missed so much. I haven't left yet but I want to come back already.

I try to get more involved with some of the communities here to the best of my ability and bandwidth. I even did the thing where I tried to hang with my coworkers. I straight up cant get anyone to commit or hang. Honestly, I cant even believe Im writing this. I've tried the ""friend"" apps like Bumble BFF.

Suggestions on my last post were mixed on where to stay. Here’s things I definitely want to do  

- eat good food (with preferably at least some halal options) 
- visit Washington park for the Japanese garden and the rose garden 
- visit Multnomah falls
- visit some shops and cafes just for funsies 


Originally I was set on a hotel in downtown. There’s lots more food there and it’s closer to Washington park so I figured I’d be there more buttt the east side has been suggested as more “Portland”esque and it would be a better mid point between Washington park and the falls. I found some bnbs near Mt. Tabor would that be a good area? 

It seems I’m going to be ubering to the parks either way but hoping to walk for food. Which option sounds better hotel in downtown or bnb on the east side?

1nmapbb,"If I were to look for records and correspondence relating to the expulsion of Roma from Portland, Oregon in December 1944, where should I start?",33,1758405216.0,"Some publications note that in December of 1944, Mayor Earl Riley gave special gas rations from the Office of Price Administration to dozens of families, equating to about half of Portland's Romani population at the time, and pressured them to leave the state, possibly under threat of prosecution under anti-fortune-telling and anti-storefront residency laws aimed at Roma at the time.

[Oregon Humanities](https://www.oregonhumanities.org/rll/magazine/move-fall-winter-2015/community-in-flux/) and [Oregon Roma (Gypsies) - A Hidden History](https://www.ohs.org/oregon-historical-quarterly/award-winning-articles/upload/Silverman_Roma-in-Oregon_OHQ-Winter-2017_Final.pdf) discuss this in some detail, though it's not very clear how exactly the expulsion was carried out.

I also found some newspaper clippings from Oregon and Texas from November 1944 to January 1945 that are of interest. ([1](https://i.ibb.co/m5x6BvSH/Roseburg-News-Review-Dec-28-1944-p-3.jpg), [2](https://i.ibb.co/Q1h7HbJ/Ashland-Southern-Oregon-Mail-Jan-11-1945-p-4.jpg), [3](https://i.ibb.co/HTwqQfnN/Herald-And-News-Dec-28-1944-p-1.jpg), [4](https://i.ibb.co/Wvf7W82N/Amarillo-Globe-Nov-24-1944-p-13.jpg), [5](https://i.ibb.co/0p13yrsq/Valley-Morning-Star-Jan-06-1945-p-1.jpg), [6](https://i.ibb.co/S76jjv4x/San-Antonio-Light-Jan-05-1945-p-1.jpg), [7](https://i.ibb.co/d426Yt8b/Victoria-Advocate-Jan-08-1945-p-5.jpg))

Where would I be able to get more information on this subject?

Activities 
- the plan is to stay in downtown. so far the art museum, Washington park and its gardens, and Multnomah falls are on my list.
- I like reading, artsy things, not really a thrill seeker kinda gal 

Food and Cafes 
- is there any halal food near the downtown area? If not what are some good food places that I’d enjoy? Also nice and cozy cafes would be great. Can’t do any bars for obvious reasons 

Multnomah Falls 
- ok I’m not sure if I should do this one. It’s the biggest thing I have for this potential trip but here’s my thing. I’m not a huge nature person in the sense of hiking. I know I don’t have to hike to see the falls but would it be worth it? I also plan to take the gorge express bus and wanted to know if that’d be a safe idea 

Transportation 
- the MAX rail system looks manageable. The plan is that, walking, and uber if I’m feeling anxious 

Overall, do yall think I’ll be okay as a hijabi woman? Would I be a rare sighting?

So this is something my roommate and I have been struggling with for a while, and I’m starting to feel kind of crazy. Since earlier this year, pretty often when we buy fresh meat or seafood, we take it home only to find out that it’s rotten. Recently I really wanted some salmon, and it seriously took me six attempts before I finally found some that was edible. I once even asked at the seafood counter, and the clerk told me that the salmon had arrived that day. Still rotten. Twice now, my roommate has bought vacuum sealed beef that turned out to be rotten. He’s at his wits end and is considering just giving up meat.

This has happened at Safeway, Freddy’s, New Seasons, Whole Foods, and Grocery Outlet. We’re not buying the discounted “managers special” stuff that they’re just trying to get rid of either. It’s happening with full price items that are supposed to be fresh and far from their expiration dates.

Ten years ago, I could buy two pounds of salmon and eat it over the course of several days. Now I’m lucky if the salmon I buy to eat that night is edible.

Has anyone else experienced this? I also work retail and I’m surprised I haven’t had customer complaints when it’s something my roommate and I have been struggling with. Are we just really unlucky?

Edit: It’s not my fridge. I’m talking about things I buy and then try to cook on the same day. ",15,askportland

“As someone that is sensitive to fragrances, I try and do as much fragrance free as possible - plus given how powerful dog noses are, I like to be mindful of that as much as possible.
However, some of our cleaners do have an odor (Simple Green, Lemon DC, bleach/water - obviously, not used
in conjunction with each other).  Potentially, we could give him a bath before he leaves if you have a special shampoo he uses.“

Hey, y'all! Some of you may know me by now, but if not: Hi, I'm Bryan, the founder/publisher of [Stumptown Savings](https://stumptownsavings.com/subscribe), aka the grocery guy. I spend a lot of time in grocery stores for my reporting. But I'd never been to a [Chuck's Fresh Markets](https://chucksproduce.com/) before this week. For those not in the know, it's a Clark County, Washington, grocery chain with two locations. I was really impressed with the quality of produce, the prices, and the product selection when I stopped into one while up in Vancouver earlier this week. If we had one of these in Portland proper, I'd probably be shopping here every week. (Fun fact: It shares the same corporate owner as the Salem-area chain [Roth's Fresh Markets](https://www.roths.com/).)

That got me thinking: What other grocery chains do Portlanders wish we had here? It could be something only available in the 'burbs, like Uwajimaya; or something from another state, like Publix; or even something from another country, like the amazing Canadian grocer T&T Market.

This cakey/pie was not quite a St. Louis gooey butter cake, but close. Back in the day the small bakery that supplied to New Seasons would ship, so I sent one once to my Mom in Georgia (and yes, I dug through my old emails to see if I could find confirmation receipt). I remember on the bakery website the baker said it was adapted from an older family recipe - maybe German? Dutch? I seem to remember they didn't sell anything other than this particular cake/pie. But I could be misremembering. 

I've tried to recreate it using recipes for boterkoek and butter kucken, and boterkoek is close, but I don't remember the New Season's quite as almondy. It was sold as a round pie - very dense like a blondie. No almonds or anything else. Just dense sugary chewy goodness. 

I called folks at New Seasons Central bakery a few years ago and one person remembered there'd been an issue with the packaging (apparently not sturdy enough), but they couldn't remember the name of the bakery. 

Pretty sure the bakery is not in business anymore because I've looked up just about every single bakery in the Northwest. But if anyone can without a doubt confirm the name of the bakery, I can try and get in contact with the original baker. If someone has a recipe dupe that matches?

My brother died at 22 four years ago to cancer, my sister died last year at 26 to a cardiac arrest.  My moms now in hospice 6 weeks into a 2 weeks left to live.  I started really focusing on making music right, well my girl absolutely hates on me for it.  She keeps saying like why are you making these songs I thought you were just making it for yourself so why are you producing them and publishing them on Apple Music?  I said because I’m so damn hurt and I want people to know my story.  She doesn’t like that.  She says it’s not like you’re going to make it big or anything.  But I’m starting to get support from Oregon, Washington, Montana, and North Carolina.  I even got a radio station interview with a guy set up from New York.  She’s hating on that my song will go on the radio saying this guys a scammer but he has thousands of followers, interviews all over his business page etc with big names artists who came out of his radio station too.  Now I released an album called Out The Cage and it drops on the 17th of September.  She was mad at me for putting so much time into.  She just bashes on me man.  I just want my music to hit fans exactly how I feel in my everyday life and I think that’s what she’s worried about.  I put so much time and effort into my album to make sure it’s not pointing fingers at anyone especially her.  She sucks man.  Yesterday she got home and was explaining to me how some kid was treating her at school because she’s a teacher and she said he stomped on her foot so she kicked the kid.  She showed me an example by stepping on my foot and twisting her foot on top of my bare foot, then decided she was going to stomp on it.  Man I’m trying to love this lady but she’s the most disrespectful person I have ever met in my life.  If we get into any sort of argument she just straight attacks me and will not defend our relationship or anything we have.  I know it would be best to just leave this situation but from all my loss I’ve missed a ton of work and had to pay months of rent payments on credit cards.  I know owe $70k in credit card debt.  So I’m paying a minimum of $2000 a month just in bills that have interests.  Then my rent alone is $3000.  I’m working my ass off trying to support her and her family too but she gives me so little in return.  I have no friends either.  My dad lives in a studio, and my brother lives in his own studio too.  Credit is dog shit.  I make $100k a year but can’t get a rental due to my credit.  Anyone in Portland Oregon area need a roommate?  Anyone wanna hear my music?  It hits real deep and has a lot of trap style stuff in it too.  Right now my single Out the Cage is released and live on all music platforms.  Check it out @SkillyWill ",26,PDX

I've included a little about me and listed what I'm looking for below, so if places you are recommending meet these, or are missing some, please feel free to share what might be included/excluded. Thanks in advance for all the help!

About me
Mid 30's guy. LGBT identifying. Like to participate in various adult recreational sports/leagues and social events. Looking for somewhere that is walkable and social but doesn't necessarily need to be right in the middle of everything. An area where people are friendly or if there is a good meeting spot to socialize would be nice since I won't know many people if I make the move.

Budget
- Ideally I would like to be at $1500 or less. Not necessarily the lower the better, but trying to be reasonable while meeting my higher priority items below.

Amenities
Higher priority amenities I would like on my wish list
- 1 bedroom (large studio could possibly work depending on layout and square footage)
- 575+ sq feet (I work remote so need some room for my desk and normal living)
- W/D in unit (if not in unit then onsite at minimum)
- Parking spot available/included (covered preferably)
- A/C
- Onsite fitness center/gym (not a requirement but would love it)
- A building that doesn't need a lot of repairs (ex: not turning off water every other week for repairs)

Medium priority amenities that would be nice to have
- Bike parking or storage
- Dishwasher
- Secure/gated entry
- Something with a view that's not just facing another building or wall would be nice
- Community/apartment events/socials to meet people/neighbors
- Swimming Pool and/or hot tub

Location
- Walkable neighborhood to park(s), grocery store, coffee shop, and a few social bars to meet people.
- Safe area

Please feel free to share any and all recommendations, links to apartment complex websites or property management websites you recommend, etc. I would plan on visiting in the next two months or so and moving early next year. Thanks again everyone!",11,PDX

Many of these matches occur on turf where temps can be as much as 40º higher than the air temperature. While players can sub out and get in front of a fan, get more water, get a cold wash cloth, etc... The refs are out there on the pitch at a constant for the entire match, and matches are back-to-back-to-back-to-back. We saw multiple refs experiencing heat exhaustion causing other refs to have to race across town and officiate ""one more match"". We even had a situation where a match had to start late and our ref officiated the whole match well after sundown on an unlit field. The kids could see, but the old parent eyes could only see a white ball and boots.

Somehow, in all of this, we still have parents on the side lines that feel fit to audibly criticize these referees despite the fact that the game simply cannot happen without them.

So here's to you refs. I know it's not the pay that brings you out.  Your love for the game enables you to put up with the heat and the bullshit so that these kids can love this game the way you do. We appreciate you.",0,PDX

I could see lots of orange, and it looked like it was dripping flaming  material.  The dripping effect must have been caused by the way it was crumbling apart, rather than something more sudden.

The meteor was traveling south to north.  This event was located to the west.
The downward angle was roughly 35 degrees.
I wasn't aware of any sound because I was inside.
It went behind some hills and I list sight. 
It would be cool if others saw.

1mlv56t,Good hotel for visiting son?,6,1754760652.0,I've been waiting for my son (33) to visit since my soon-to-be-ex and I moved here and bought a house a few years ago. Now I'm living in a rented room without a spare guest room and he will be visiting next month. I told him I'd get a nice hotel room for him - I think 3 or 4 nights. The only Portland hotel I've ever stayed in was the Monaco (now Royal Sonesta) over 10 years ago. Son has never been to Portland.

I am posting this to request any cell phone video of a security incident that occurred at C C slaughters on July 19 around 9:30 PM. This request is of my own accord and is not requested by any of the parties involved.

Two friends of mine went to cc slaughters on July 19. When one of them (a person of color) went to order a drink, the bartender made it incorrectly. When she politely corrected him, he flipped out and told her that he was going to call security and call the cops on her. She backed away from him slowly and joined my other friend, her girlfriend. Before they knew it two security guards , scooped my friend up from behind each arm, and told her that she needed to leave. While dragging her out of the bar. Once outside, they pinned her to the ground. Her girlfriend, was understandably very distraught. She, as well as a good Samaritan, who saw the entire incident, tried to stop security from continuing to assault her. When the police came, they arrested, my friend who was pinned by security, my other friend (her girlfriend), as well as the good Samaritan. 

The cops claim they saw bar’s security footage of my friend, punching the security guards, but that simply isn’t true. Multiple witnesses saw that she was being dragged or pinned the entire time completely helpless. I looked at her hands myself, and there are no injuries to indicate that she punched somebody multiple times. She does however have multiple injuries to her head and neck from being assaulted by the security guards. 

My friends are getting an attorney, but we are fearful that the security footage will “disappear” when the bar closes down. Please if you were there that night. And you witnessed this incident and even better if you took cell phone video DM me.

I'm in the early stages of a documentary project about Portland's cable access television scene during the 1980s and 90s and ***I need your help***!

**Some context about the project:**

* I'm exploring how cable access TV during this time period reflected Portland's unique culture and provided space for creative expression.
* I'm currently looking at shows like Jim Spagg, The Chess Show, Insanity, Where's the Art, but interested in ALL cable access programming from this period.
* Currently investigating themes of free expression, censorship challenges, how marginalized communities used this platform, and the preservation efforts happening today
* I'm interested in documenting the history and legacy of community media in PDX

**I'm hoping to connect with:**

* People who created or worked on cable access shows
* Viewers who regularly watched or called in
* Staff who worked at the stations/facilities
* Anyone with archives, recordings, or memorabilia
* Those who remember how cable access impacted Portland's communities

**If you or someone you know was part of this scene, I'd love to hear:**

* What shows do you remember watching or creating?
* Any memorable moments, episodes, or personalities?
* How did cable access reflect Portland's culture at that time?
* Do you have any recordings, photos, or materials from that era?
* How did your experience with cable access impact you?

This is a passion project aimed at preserving this unique piece of Portland's media history before memories and materials are lost to time. I'm particularly interested in how cable access television provided a platform for voices and perspectives that weren't represented in mainstream media.

Feel free to comment below or DM me if you'd prefer to share privately. I'm happy to chat over coffee with anyone who has stories to share!

Thank you!",2,PDX

NEED FOOTAGE FROM ANY HOME CAMERAS PLEASE!

Updated 4/22

Photos are attached of the tall young man in the ski mask. He was also one of the attackers that gave most of the blows to my nephews head. HIS NAME IS CORDELL AND HE GOES TO ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL.

The girl with the blue headband is the “ringleader” female of the group of students that antagonized and attacked my nephew goes by the last name Spencer. She is most likely an 8th grader at George Middle School. Her father possibly last named Spencer was also present during a shakedown that occurred at the park on Friday 4/18 that also involved my nephew being intimidated by this grown adult, he was also in a face covering and red baseball cap which is very disturbing. He is allegedly a boxer (as said by the  antagonizing female).

Location: Burr Ave at George Park playground.

Date/time: 4/21 between 3:30pm and 4:15pm

PPB Case # 25-103022

Police and schools are AWARE…

Today my 15 year-old nephew with Autism Spectrum Disorder was attacked by 7 students. At least 1 from Roosevelt and the others from George. They broke his phone and stole his cash. 

He had been hit repeatedly in the head by one student and has huge red marks on his inner arm and is sore on other various parts of his body.
He’s processing the incident and I’ll provide any more info when I can.

Please if anyone has any footage of 2 females and  5 males of different races walking NORTH toward Fessenden. 

The police have been notified and all surrounding schools know everything.

Thank you in advance for any help.

Also, thank you for the peers who stepped in and the adult who helped bring him home safely!!",10,PDX

1jigcph,Are there any companies that accept teens with only a highschool graduate and only 5 previous jobs?,8,1742782657.0,"Hi! I'm so sorry if this isn't a good place to ask, or is a stretch to ask for, but I'm at a loss right now. 

I just graduated highschool last summer and had been trying to find work, I had a job but it was only seasonal and I was let go after 3 months. I've been trying to find a new one and have applied quite literally every business with a career page, or application options, that I could find. Not a single store will except me because I don't have enough customer service experience, and food places won't take me either because I'm over qualified (I still got no clue what that means honestly.) 
No matter where I apply to, I hear nothing back from the application. I'm a little fearful to keep finding fast food places to apply to in Portland because my disability affects my ability to walk really long distances, and I live in Hillsboro, I don't know if any fast food places far from me would be willing to accept me long term because of me having medical episodes. 

My last job was a warehouse one, I tried looking for other jobs like it close to me since I walk, take the max, and bus places, however I only find places asking for a degree in something for lots of experience. 

I've worked at a radio station and a clinic as an intern, and was a full time nanny between ages 13 - 15 in foster care where I had to administer medication and watch over the kids while the parents left often. The same time I also baby sat occasionally so I'd have extra money. 

I haven't found a single place willing to take me that normal teens go for, so I was going to try finding either remote jobs, or companies that are also warehouse, or things that tie into experience I already have such as event planning when i was with the radio station. 
I was hoping, if my past jobs and disabilities disqualify me from most retail and customer service jobs, if I could find at least something in line of what I've done before so hopefully they'd take me. 

Does anyone know of any jobs that would accept a work history like this, or a woman with only a highschool diploma and disabilities? I will take any job that has a chance at accepting me, as long as it's within 1 1/2 - 2 hour commute since I'd be walking and taking the max most of the way. 

I'm really sorry if this question is really redundant as well, I'm just really struggling and unsure where to go if most teenage accepting jobs aren't accepting my applications, I don't know where to go. 

I also apologize for any spelling errors or if the way I word things was weird, or if i rambled a little too much, I haven't slept in days trying to find some sort of job and stressing over it. My father is also out of work and I was the one bringing in money at my last job, so I'm stressing trying to find something that pays at least a little over minimum wage so I can keep us afloat until he finds something. 

Thank you so much for reading.

1idcbrj,"If Multnomah County Won't Act on Crime, Let’s Make Them!",0,1738205340.0,"I wanted to share something I’ve been thinking about regarding property crime in our community and what I believe the county should do to address it. Over the years, Multnomah County has drastically cut its jail capacity, leaving many empty jail beds and insufficient funding for our district attorney’s office to go after criminals meaningfully. This is having a direct impact on our neighborhood's safety. You see it posted here almost every day or week. Fr.

The sad truth is that while county officials seem to express concern about the crime happening, they haven't really prioritized addressing it in the ways we need, like focusing on appropriate policing, prosecution, and putting consequences in place for those committing property crimes. That’s why I’m proposing a new initiative called the Accountability for Property Crime Initiative. Working Title at the moment.

This initiative is designed to hold county leaders accountable by providing a 'Crime Victim Compensation Fund' to help property crime victims. The way things are now if your car gets broken into or your bike gets stolen, the inconvenience is bad enough. But if someone’s job depends on their car or their livelihood relies on their bike, that impact is devastating. The same goes for small business owners dealing with constant break-ins and vandalism. This proposal would help them directly by providing compensation for crime victims and helping those who are struggling with these issues.

Here’s what the proposal would do:

1. **County Charter Amendment**: This would ensure that the charter takes precedence over other ordinances and cannot be changed without a vote of the people.
2. **Victim Compensation**: The County would pay victims up to $2,500 per occurrence, and claims would need to be processed within 60 days, at least until crime levels return to pre-pandemic levels.
3. **Crime Victim's Office**: It would create a dedicated office to handle victim claims, similar to the one a commercial insurance company has.
4. **Incentivized County Action**: The county would be incentivized to pursue criminals to recover the payouts made to victims.
5. **No New Taxes**: The program would be funded by the County, but it **can’t raise taxes.** This would likely push the County to prioritize funds and make necessary budget cuts in less essential areas.

This initiative would create real change and force the County to act for the people most affected by crime. It could also encourage the County to reopen and expand jail space, leading to fewer repeat offenders committing crimes while waiting for trial.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this idea. It seems like we can solve our problem... Multnomah Counties problem and help figure out this mess.

**TL;DR: Multnomah County's inaction on property crime negatively impacts everyday people. A new proposal would establish a victims’ compensation fund, providing up to $2,500 for losses until crime rates improve. This initiative would compel the county to create more jail space and hold criminals accountable while avoiding tax increases. The aim: motivate county leaders to address the issue or face the consequences.**",18,PDX

She refused to listen and kept telling me to pull out my passport and scan. I really didn’t want to argue so just scanned my passport to just prove it to her. After a few info verification then with no surprise a long document jumped up on the screen basically stating that traveller with Chinese passport would need a visa to visit Taiwan yada yada. Then I was like see that’s what I was talking about, but she wouldn’t give up and started asking me to show her my Taiwan visa. I gave her a document bag, she yanked it open and drop my stuff all over the floor!! Without a single apology she just stood there and started reading my visa. I looked at her and couldn’t believe it. She then look back at me and asked: “are you going to pick them up or what? They aren’t my stuff.” At that point I was really pissed and said:”Didn’t YOU drop them? What’s up with your attitude?!” She then threw the document back at me and said:” whatever, be my guess” and stormed away. 

This is my first time flying United after COVID and I could NOT believe what I just experienced. I don’t like playing victim but her attitude got even worse after seeing my passport which led me to believe there was also some racism against me. I asked her for her name and badge number and told her I was going to file a complaint. She refused to give me anything but her name. So I called United but according to their policy they only accept complaints after the trip is completed. Which means I can’t do anything until I return from Taiwan. 

I’m not going to reveal her name her but her initials are GV. If you are flying United out of PDX, hope you have better luck and are able to avoid this terrible experience.",4,PDX

1gejspe,2024 Portland Voter's Guide? / My impromptu MAYOR comparison,1,1730167478.0,"Previous elections I saw guides on Reddit, detailing each candidate, and coupling with ""Reddit Peer Review,"" gave me confidence to vote a little more efficiently. I'm just now opening up my ballet and trying to figure shit out. Yes I am using google, can't find.

Please share link with me if you have anything. This is taking too many hours, with so little ""umph,"" I mean, all I got on these candidates is a pamphlet, google.. well how about a list that SOMEONE'S, SOMEWHERE. HAD TO HAVE ALREADY DONE, that graphs these candidates + and -'s in a easily read and digested format?

\-----

As a side discussion (be the change you want to see, if you don't see it, start it), here's my takes on Portland MAYOR Candidates:

(feel free to tell me your opinions, and I need to do my other parts of my ballot too..)

* Keith Wilson (1st choice so far): Sounds really popular and wants to address the homelessness issue head on, without jailing them? Does anyone know this person's stance on drug legalization? I admire this guy's attitude but without seeing a list of policy decisions/stances (and only looking at a face/pamphlet description) I worry they might be a little ""boomer"" on socialist policies.
* Rene Gonzales (No) : No, because he wants to re-criminalize drugs. As much as seeing poor people from my backyard worries me, people shouldn't be incarcerated for simply using recreational drugs. The problem with the way Portland decimalized drugs was they didn't follow through with treatment plans, AFAIK, and at about the same time Police suddenly stopped enforcing the law. One redditor I argued with says PPB is understaffed... didn't seem that way during the BLM protests. lol
* Michael O'Callaghan (2nd choice so far): Wants to impose vacant housing fines. Occupation: ""Skilled Master"" (that's what pamphlet says). Wants to created PORTLAND PEOPLE POLLING, which sounds like Portland Reddit. I... like it?
* Martin Ward: Unemployed professional ""Campaigner, Researcher, ""Doing God's Will."" Seriously fuck this guy. ""Homeless relief, LOWER RENT, police/education reform, NEW PARKS, FREE COLLEGE, LOWER TAXES"" these all sound great, unless you have a brain that works, and a nose that can differentiate bullshit from apple pie. Sorry Ward, please stay out of politics. Learn from people that know what they're doing before trying to be the forefront libertarian.
* Liv (Viva) Osthus: ""Artist"" sounds like she wants to protect the environment, water the trees, emphasis on safety. My skepticism tells me she is not cut out for the job, and that she would actually have no idea what she would be doing. Like O'Callaghan, no government experience. Liv sounds like a passionate individual, with a lot of insight on what effects HER and OTHERS she's connected with. I would love to see her giving input and ideas somewhere, but I worry she wouldn't be capable of balancing a budget, or solving complicated problems, with math.
* Alexander Laundry Neely: Winemaker. Passionate about ending homelessness ""FULL STOP"" but again, doesn't impress me as someone who understands how government work. It's honestly a tie between Liv and this guy (for 3rd or 4th or whatever'th rank, not 1st LOL!)
* Sharon Nasset: Hire more cops (meh), incarcerate repeat offenders (thought we did that already?), encourage electric vehicles with ""raffles"" (wtf doesn't sound serious), opposes Toll roads (ok ig... libertarian?) I'm gonna say no. Feel free to change my mind.
* Mingus Maps: Is an **African American Democrat** and a **father"",** and those are the things they decided to bold in his description. Clean up litter and graffiti: I like the graffiti (some), I don't like the litter. ""End street camping,"" I get the feeling this person is trying to appeal to everyone, while secretly being pretty far right. They list some actual governmental ""accomplishments,"" but idk. It even looks good, from the reading, just can't get that ""bullshit"" smell, even if it's my imagination.
* Josh Leake (better than Gonzales): This man has emotional ""umph"" allover his pamphlet bio, with lots of words like ""Focus on"" and 'make better,' language. I don't want to completely count him out, because he has government and *volunteer* experience, as well as financial executive experience. My problem here is Josh has the most boring and vague PR. God damn it Josh, I just want to know one thing: Are you left or right? Are you a trumper? Are you a libertarian? Are you a socialist? Tell us who the fuck you actually are. You might be strawberry, well a lot of people really prefer chocolate. OH WELL! Be honest, regardless.
* Michael Hayes (Tied for 2nd): Looks like good amount of experience and accomplishments. Claims credit for delivering Tiered-voting, which would be pretty cool if true. I might tie Michael Hayes at 2nd choice, having now read.
* Carmen Rubio: Something about ""No drama"" and unpaid parking tickets idfk. List of ""accomplishments"" as a (checks notes) ""Senior Policy Advisor, Commissionaire Nick Fish, Director of Community Affairs, Portland MAYOR and Police Chief Tom Potter."" What the fuck am I reading? That read like she WAS mayor, I'm confused.. was she mayor? Sorry, I'm a dumbass. Some kind Redditor help pls.",6,PDX

On Mcloughlin I was going 40, and you were coming in HOT behind me and i literally had to put my foot to the floor to avoid you smashing into the back of me. Couldn’t swerve, someone was next to me.

I hope you didn’t hurt anyone and hopefully you got to where you were going safely because it was obviously important enough to put the entire public in danger. 

You’re going to kill someone.


To the driver…If for some crazy reason you ever end up coming across this post, DM me. I will give you my contact info so next time you’re too fucked to drive, you’ll have someone to call. You could’ve killed my wife and I, I’ll give a stranger a ride so someone doesn’t die, no question.

It is hard to find good staff…got that.  But other places do somehow.  And how about start in the kitchen?  You have a limited menu of items people mostly like.  Nothing too inventive…just a good selection of pub fare…and yet that too is inconsistent.  Four burgers arrive, two are well done, two have raw meat.  Get your own silverware.  Order at the bar…pay at the bar. DIY dining that feels like a cart dine at restaurant prices.

The competition is stiffer than it was when the concept started…but if you could just try a bit harder, you could turn the ship around.

Finally, if the DIY experience was turned into an actual pub experience, the tips would probably increase dramatically too.",25,PDX

***This is for cheese pizza only***


1. Scottie’s: great sauce and decent cheese but the crust is awful. It legitimately tastes like a tortilla.  5.9

2. Pizza thief: embarrassing pizza. Sour crust, no sauce, and terrible cheese. 4.2

3. Dimo’s: cooked well but the ingredients are meh and it’s a meh pizza. 5.5

4. Baby Doll: of the recommendations Baby Doll is by far the best but it’s not amazing. Solid 7 but it’s nothing special.

5. Straight from New York: crust is a bit boring and the pizza is under cooked. If it was cooked properly I’d rate it around 7 but 6.2 for execution. 

Here for another week, please give me some recommendations that will restore my faith in PDX pizza.

Preferences: prefer pizza on the thinner side but not cracker thin. Love a good sauce and crust.

So I stopped and got him in my car so he wouldn't get hit or run off to far. He had a phone number but no address on his collar. Borges doesn't have anywhere to pull off unless it's in someone's driveway, so I go 2 miles down to a store with small parking lot on foster road. I probably could have found a spot on foster road but I didn't want to be blocking the road at all or be in a driveway. It's like a 5 minute drive from where I found the dog to the store. I call the guy and tell him I'm pretty sure I've got his husky. He's says oh shit he must have slipped off his line. I tell him where I'm at and explain why I didn't stop sooner and I say I'll drive him back up to your house if you want, not a big deal. He gets mad at me for driving ""so far from his house"" and says he's going g to meet me at the store anyways. He pulls in screeches to a stop jumps out and throws open his door for his dog. The dog didn't want to get in so he kinda just threw it in the back. Didn't even say thank you or anything. Then says next time just leave his dog or take it to the pound. How was I supposed to know exactly where the dog came from? Was I wrong to drive 2 miles with the dog and then call him? Even after offering to drive back? If I see this dog again should I leave in the middle of the road or should I pick him up and take him to the pound?

### Check in for updates

*Curious Comedy Theater & Funhouse Lounge would like to accommodate this event in the future and I think both are great choices.*

I noticed that when you first call the number it has a very long introduction, followed by the exact same excessively lengthy introduction entirely in Spanish (instead of the usual, “por Español prima a número dos” phrase). Perhaps I’m just paranoid, but it just seems like it took more and more roadblocks to actually connecting people with the seemingly ghost of a street response team, by putting in more and more roadblocks.

zp4o4a,Protesters need to execute better,8,1671387654.0,"Protesters -- do better! This attempt at increasing awareness and building support backfires on you.

On Saturday the family grabbed a tree and headed to Fernill park for a quick moment with the dog.  Standing at the SE corner we heard a cacophony of car horns coming North on 42nd - they turned and headed towards the park.  What is this? A low-rent funeral procession? A team celebration for winning something?  Some weird new car-horn kink? It certainly is an auditory assault on a nice day at the park!

The second car in the procession had an open hatch and a speaker facing out the back. Because the speaker is, you know, facing BACKWARDS it is only as the car gets 150'+ past us that we can make out what the person is telling us ... something about keeping the streets safe, that we aren't waving, that we're a bunch of racists for not waving.  WTF? I'm a racist for watching your little parade and trying to figure out why you are there?  Turns out the LAST car is flying two flags, one of which is BLM.  OH...

Your execution is incredibly poor! Please, flags at the front - and preferably a banner that faces forward - maybe even signs on the side of your car (a kindergartner can help you with that) so onlookers KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Omnidirectional speakers ...or at least understand that people can't hear you until you're well down the road.  And don't call people racist just because they can't make sense of your little parade - instead of building support you just fed the narrative that calls of racism are baseless.",16,PDX

ori40k,Community project: Would you like to build a spreadsheet?,9,1627241272.0,"I'm working on a few projects with the intent of promoting community assistance with community problems. I'm at square 1 now, but **I would love some help putting together some resources for people to use.** The general intent of this project is to get information about city resources to y'all in the hopes of demystifying some aspects of Portland's notoriously silly form of government and creating opportunities for people to safely assist fellow redditors and Portlanders.  

The current projects I have in mind are:  

* A stolen vehicle spreadsheet that folks can reference, compiled from reddit posts (and possibly nextdoor, craigslist, etc)  

* An interactive chart of Portland's agencies and bureaus and the services they provide  

* A list of Apps that you can download and use to stay up to date about various conditions (crime, weather, health concerns, etc) in the Portland area  

* Free or very affordable skill building classes that teach life saving techniques, like CPR/First Aid, mental health awareness, strategies for crisis intervention and suicide prevention, natural disaster response, etc...  

* Objective data mapping for things like crime statistics and city responses to promote informed discourse  

If that sounds interesting, or if you have an even better idea for ways to help out the community, please leave a comment!

My idea is to record a brief 1-3 minute trailer, once that is done, I will post it on GoFundMe and try to make a professional movie that will be entered in Film Festivals.

*All Actors need to have the ability to cry on command.

Actors Needed

Nessa (23) - Scrawny African American woman who is wise beyond her years, but still has a lot to learn. 

Maggy (6) - Small white girl. Extremely optimistic and hopeful, but is starting to show signs of bi-polar disorder.

Lenny (30-40's) - (Any Ethnicity) Caring child protective service officer. 

Pea (30-40's) - (Any Ethnicity) Child Psychologist and wife of Lenny. Pea is very observant and intelligent, but doesn't come off as overly smart.

Marge (30's) - White woman. Marge is the adult version of Maggy. Marge is a very loving woman, when it comes to her kids. She is very stressed and tired all the time. 

Grant (30's) - (Any Ethnicity) Marges Husband who is basically her 3rd child. He has depth and emotion, but he hides it a lot.

Of course, these are very broad versions of the character. If you would like to know more, or if you're interested in the project and getting your name and acting credits out there email me: justinmichaels97@gmail.com

If you are looking to be one of the actors, sending any good picture of yourself or a video of you doing a monologue just to gauge your ability. Thanks and have a great day.",15,PDX
o939mp,"PSA: Do not use dry ice to cool your home. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide, and can genuinely kill you.",47,1624820323.0,"A couple pounds of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) is enough to give you CO2 poisoning in a reasonably sized room once sublimated. 

I know it's very hot outside, and dry ice plus a fan might seem like a good solution. You CAN use it, but if you do, please put it inside of a tightly sealed flexible airtight container like a heavy vacuum sealed bag, and blow the fan over that instead. The bag will contain the sublimated CO2, and - you know - not kill you.

I recommend a small chunk of dry ice per large sealed container, so the container doesn't burst as the CO2 sublimates.

Be safe today, friends.

EDIT: Also, please be aware that opening your fridge or freezer will not cool down your home. It will actually INCREASE the average temperature in your home because of the way the compressor works in the cooling unit. Every bit of heat you put into your fridge will be returned to your home, plus a little extra since the compressor is not 100% efficient.",3,PDX

1nt0m9g,Live in NW/downtown Portland or 10-15min drive from downtown in bigger & cheaper apt?,16,1759095913.0,"So I'm moving to Portland soon, and I can't decide where to live. I'm coming from Medford, OR, and I've been daydreaming about walking in walkable neighborhoods/downtown areas, getting coffee etc... but I'm apartment searching on a budget. So I'm looking mostly at 1 bedrooms under $1300/mo.

Anyways, I've found a few options with some options in the NW/Alphabet district, a few just outside downtown lines next to PSU, and some that are in the Multnomah Village area.

The best bang for my buck option I found is a 1bd 1bath apt 580sq/ft with 1 parking spot included for $1100/mo in the Multnomah Village area (10-15mins from downtown). After that there's apt options next to PSU just outside downtown lines for around $1200/mo with 500sq/ft and street permit parking. Last is NW/Alphabet district apartment options at $1300/mo to live in a smaller 400-500sq/ft apartment, but walkability is amazing. Street parking is more risky for break-ins here, though.

Anyways, is the walkable neighborhood in NW worth the extra $200/mo in costs? Or would it not feel like I miss anything from living a 10-minute drive away from downtown?

I 100% want my car, so I have to take into account parking costs. Would a middle-ground location, like being close to PSU, but not directly in a walkable neighborhood, be a good option? I also work 100% remote, which is why the size of the apt is a concern for me.

I get that I can only know what I really want for myself, but I want your opinions on how you feel about that trade-off personally.

1nrtsfx,Are traumatic arrivals to Portland common?,0,1758975553.0,"Hi Portland, let me introduce myself.

I arrived in late 2015 as a college-educated young woman from the East Coast in my late 20s. My father, who was from Europe, had just died traumatically, and I was escaping domestic abuse from my American mother and her family. I was in a highly distressed state, going in and out of stress-induced psychosis from untreated PTSD.

I didn’t really understand what I was walking into but immediately became a victim of crime. I was nearly sex trafficked after being drugged. I remember somehow being in Old Town and becoming non-verbal. The man with me was taking my phone, wallet, and ID—this was happening **in front of a doorman at Stag Bar who did absolutely nothing.**

I finally snapped out of it and ran. He chased me all the way to Burnside Bridge, where I saw a cop car and collapsed, thinking I was safe. Instead, I woke up in jail, being cavity searched, charged with “disturbing a peace officer,” and stripped of my underwear.

I was released, then placed in a psych ward to stabilize. While there, I learned there was a warrant for my arrest because I missed a court date while still in the ward. My family decided to abandon me in Portland and never contacted my European relatives.

I ended up with the first safe man I met, as many vulnerable people do, and had to heal my brain in the same city that traumatized me.

Then the pandemic hit. When I tried reconnecting with my mom, she tricked me into a sober living house in another state. I escaped through another psych ward and made my way back to Portland.

Now I feel lost and stuck. I’ve been here on and off for years but never felt like I’ve truly *lived* in this city. I’ve been taken advantage of while seeking friendship. People want my money. I’ve been screamed at by bus boys for not knowing I had to bus my table (BTW, bussed my own table in Bingen and they were very confused and I had to apologize that I was from Portland).  I’ve even been accused of being from California and to go back there, though I’ve never even been there.

Recently I was diagnosed with CPTSD. I had been self-medicating with heavy cannabis use to try and re-expose myself to life, but it makes me prone to psychosis. On the positive side, while recovering I pursued a self-directed “master’s equivalent” in computer science. I have real skills and capabilities, but stepping into full self-agency still feels excruciating, but I want it badly.

I guess I’m posting this because I don’t want to feel invisible anymore. Has anyone else felt like an outsider here even after years? Are there safe communities, peer groups, or spaces in Portland where people with trauma can actually connect without being exploited? I'm not queer presenting and people seem to not want me in a lot of spaces here.

Thanks for listening.",9,PortlandOR

This morning I tried to pick up a stupid free Pokemon code at GameStop for myself and my kid brother before dropping my fianceé off at work. The place was a madhouse which I should've expected, and in my fury at the handling of the release, I missed the saddest interaction I've ever witnessed. 

The store decided to arbitrarily set a policy to charge a $15 minimum to hand out the *free* codes for the game. 

A cashier, whom I am certain is the GM of that store enforced this rule for everyone besides anyone who stood their ground wanting to avoid an argument. 

A very sweet larger man in a blue hoodie was in line ahead of us, and went up to ask for the code. The GM denied him, the man in the blue hoodie begged, *begged* her for the code- he brought his switch, he tried to show her his thousand hours in his game. This is someone who *CLEARLY* loved his game and just wanted his free shiny pokemon, promised by all the advertising. She denied him with the fakest saccharine ""sorry *sweetie*"", and went right back to mechanically pitching their stupid pro program to everything with a pulse. 

I got my code, furious at the change in policy and left, but my fianceé saw this poor gentleman **SOBBING** on the planter/bench outside of the nearby Subway. I regret spending a penny there, much less for something that should've been FREE. 

I know this is some stupid rant over a pokemon gift code, but if anyone knows that guy, let me know so I can give him mine. 

And please PLEASE, don't spent a **cent** at that store. ",30,PortlandOR

The study showed that:

*According to the tests, 100% of sampled surfaces on TriMet light rails tested positive for low levels of meth. Other findings across TriMet found low levels of fentanyl across 37.5% of air samples collected and 50% of surface samples as positive for fentanyl.*

This unnecessarily scared people, you see, and discouraged them from riding TriMet.  TriMet therefore never should havre done the study, or should have at least kept the results secret.

1npspou,Trying to remember the names of my favorite places when I lived there 2000-2004,10,1758760156.0,"TL/DR Edit: I never appreciated Texas until I moved to Portland, where I was taught old honky tonk country music was cool and people were sad my Austin accent wasn’t Texan enough. Now I’m stuck in a Texas hell hole (even Austin is squeezed by this giant red state) and miss the PNW terribly. So, I love all of you strangers for possibly existing in this magical place I experience for 4 years in my mid-twenties. Thank you!

Hi! I’m really longing for my time in Portland today. It’s been over 20 years since I moved back to my hometown of Austin, but the nostalgia is making my heart ache today because I haven’t been back since then. 

I was in my 20s back then, and didn’t learn to like beer until I lived there. I also learned how to play pool and became a pinball addict while I was there. Anyway, I was trying to remember all of my favorite haunts today. 

My home bar was definitely Beulahland and I spent many a regular evening, thanksgiving for orphaned transplants, soapbox derbies, backyard barbecues, camping trips to the coast, and 50s-60s ska/reggae nights with that whole crew (Andrea & Jimmy 💗). 

I also spent a lot of time at Chez What, which had the best bar food I’ve ever had to this day. 

When I was brand new in Portland, I searched for dive bars and went to a place I cannot remember the name of. I think it was on Burnside on the west side. I randomly showed up one night and they were having “trash bag night.” The door guy hands us a trash bag we have to wear as clothing. So we make dresses and put them on. Go inside and there is a fucking slip and slide happening with the bartenders spraying club soda on the ground while people run and slide on the wet floor in their garbage bags. Hilarious times! As gross as this was, that’s when I knew I was in the right city. Anyone know the name of this place?

I was also a 90s swing dance teacher, so I spent a lot of time dancing around town at the Crystal Ballroom, The Laurelthirst with Pete Krebs, that sort of thing and other places I can’t remember. 

I think I went to Billy Ray’s a lot before I moved. It was closer to my NoPo house than Beulahland.

1npqg68,Looking for safer places for long solo bike rides in the city,16,1758753916.0,"I’m a sixty-something retiree. I loved the bicycle life for decades, even working in a shop for many years. Medical issues forced me to retire early. I am \*slowly\* regaining some of my strength and stamina after dealing with Long Covid, and riding my bicycle has been helpful for this. I’d like to begin riding farther than my neighborhood, maybe work my way up to a ten-mile ride.

The challenge is that I’m still way too slow to keep up with a group ride, and many of the places I used to enjoy riding before Covid — the I-205 path, Springwater Corridor, Delta Park path and Marine Drive — are now too sketchy for me to feel comfortable riding alone. I’ve tried bits of the first two and found lots of homeless encampments, spent syringes and human waste (sometimes literally blocking the path) and I really want to avoid the risk and drama.

I’ve mentioned this to a few bicycling friends — who are all younger and healthier than I am — and I’ve grown tired of being told to take more self-defense classes, consider carrying a weapon or just “grow a spine.” (Obviously, I don’t ride with these friends anymore, because I can’t keep up and they generally left me behind when I got really sick.)

I’m trying to stay positive, but it’s hard. And I am not ready to give up on riding. It brings me too much joy.

Looking for suggestions for east side locations to enjoy mellow rides, reasonably near transit in case I need to go multi-modal. A bench where I can take a lunch break would be great. Thanks.",30,PortlandOR
1nppn1i,Jobs please?,0,1758751838.0,"Hey folks,

I'm new to Portland and I'm hoping for some guidance from Portlandians on possibly pointing out some jobs that are hiring, I've hit a wall. Recently got laid off, can't extend unemployment. Maybe someone knows about a job that's open, but that might not be posted somewhere. I know that's slim in 2025, but I am in need of a job asap and it's been tough to find something. I've scoured the internet on every known and unknown job site for weeks. I've cold called and visited places, and I've applied for so, so many jobs, but so far no luck.

Thanks to anyone who might throw an idea my way of where to look and apply.  
Here are some qualifications that I have:  
\- I speak four languages. One of them is Spanish, but it's not fluent. My French is from Canada, which I can speak really well. Russian and English I am fluent in.  
\- BA in Psychology, certified in Hypnosis.  
\- worked with vulnerable populations.  
\- managed social media accounts, simple stuff, not full on content creation.  
\- worked in zero-waste consulting for residential homes (not businesses).  
\- worked with a non-profit creating events and finding volunteers. Experience managing volunteers.

I would love to find a job I really care about. I'm very passionate about what I do and care a lot about my work.

If I can enter the creative field or holistic healing field, great.  
However, at this point, I am not picky, I just need it to pay a living wage (around $24/hour+). I have two senior dogs, one of my dogs had cancer removal surgery this year and I haven't been able to catch up on my CCs, but my dog is cancer-free, so that's all that matters. And I'd like for the commute to be 40 minutes, or ideally a lot less, by public transport so I will have the time to walk my dogs properly after work. Hybrid or remote would be great, too.  
I live near Slabtown.  
I also have a lot of experience in restaurants (hosting/serving, not bartending) and grocery stores. A steady full-time server job would be great, but that's been hard to find. I check Poached religiously. Most places at the moment are looking for part-time and without guaranteed hours.

If anyone can throw some leads my way, I would be eternally grateful. Thank you.

While waiting for the bus on Saturday morning at 6:10, a man approached the stop. He had no shirt on, but an unzipped water resistant (black) jacket with matching water resistant pants. I backed away from the bus stop sign to give him space, he walked onto Macadam, swooped back onto the sidewalk, then settled into a crouch about 25 feet away from me/the bus stop sign. Okay, bit weird. NBD. 

I noticed he had a paper cup without a lid. I think a utility knife was in the cup, but it was still dark so I'm not sure. Again, weird, but, okaaaaay. 

While still crouched, he began to play with matches. He eventually got one to catch fire, started to burn something, but then allowed his entire hand to become engulfed in flames. Uhhhhh. Then made some motions around the cup, put the burning thing on the ground, and dropped down to do a bunch of push-ups (on pavement sparkling with broken glass). 

I immediately moved to the edge of sidewalk, turned on my phone's flashlight and checked the location of the bus. 4 min. I stood facing him so I could watch him. The bus arrived. He did not get on.

I felt like I belonged no matter where I went, even if I didn't know a single person. There was always something fun happening or I could take the dogs for amazing hikes within an hour. I miss smelling spent grain in the air, I miss running along the Willamette and dropping my feet in at the dock. I miss the endless coffee shops, getting lost in Powell's, wandering through the Saturday market. Yeah, I miss seeing people in flannels and beanies or head to toe in Nike or Adidas and chuckling at how on-brand some of the stereotypes are. As I head in for my next piercing or tattoo, or to have my vivid balayage redone :) I miss collectively bracing for 6 months of grey because this is how it is and what we do, then everyone flooding the parks at the first sign of summer. I miss driving to wine country in the valley. I miss free Shakespeare in the parks, and D&D at TPK, and screaming FUCK SEATTLE at soccer games (Thorns are way better than the Timbers lol). I miss having good dive bars, food trucks, and fine dining all scattered across the city. I miss griping about the train stopping 89 times a week, and dusting off my grudge against PBOT every November for Leaf Day. I miss looking out at evergreens and Mt. Hood. I miss hiking around Mt. Hood! Portland has its problems and it can be hard just to make it sometimes, but to me it was always worth it. We struggle but we never give up, politically, economically, or personally.

1nlqghx,Compassion > Crisis,0,1758348321.0,"Muskrats, mules, contemplators and creatures of the night, fall into place as we refute this nations guts in disgrace. Witches, carpenters and worms, squirm into oblivion while the night sinks deep into the dreams of last year. The anonymity, sunk deep within our lungs has left us desperate. Lost. Frameless yet robust with displacement. 



Streets full of losers, time abusers and down on their luck snoozers. While the clock arms progress laterally the air is reminiscent of promise. Echoes of our minds hallway. Frozen in terror we succumb to nothingness and parades in blatant disregard to our blood. How staunch the divide of you and yourself. So comfortable we can line up to complain. Was it the end or the beginning we were longing for? Pull out the answer with your blank faced stare and pause in the distance, softly, amidst fresh autumn air.



Your youth. Your booth. The most dangerous option in the face is the hounds’ tooth. Cunning tongues and sharp razors, day debaters, sideline phasers slinging poetic prophecy surrounded by perceived verbal tasers. Confused and abused but our control remains on cruise - absent option. Although I haven’t lost my voice and I’ll never bow, you can break me in your mind if it makes you proud. Gaps in time. Inherited limits.



When we lose our peripheral what is the price? What currency of complaint are you selling? Who’s willing to be accountable? The answer isn't complex... it's in the main vein right on Broadway. Slept crawlers dividing your peace... piece by piece. Opened eyes are the price. The prize.



It wasn’t long after the rebirth that the humidity set in. Surrounded by performers and tap dancing nonce’s... absent in the wind. We are relentlessly embracing the thought of control. The selfish notion of control. The mechanism in our pocket that abuses our innocence. Go ahead. Take your time.



Nothing adjacent to safety under the guise of film like a naked sheet in the wind. Closed doors and sideline whores abuse the light when they only sleep in darkness. You cannot avoid yourself but of course we'll take your money honey. We know what you need to hear. Be free or be grateful - one’s got less to do with the faithful. We run blind to find a line up to the bent knee that’s been removed... where is matter sourced from?



How can everything be so different and yet so much of it uninspired? When did we conspire? And now our embrace remains in a rampant state of disguise. Bathed and soaked in lies. The bathtub is full and there’s still a line to get in. Drink little piggies. Get your jammies on and swim. Embrace your ineptitude and stare directly into the sun. Back to the shadows with your ideals and shortcomings. Frolic in your pathetic praises and validations. You mean nothing more and nothing less. Whomever told you or didn’t tell you has rearranged your face. Go ahead, reach into your pocket. Pick it up and drink it in. If you didn’t already just agree to these terms and conditions. You are in no position to be anything more and so so so much less. This isn’t a game. You are nothing. It’s not sad or untrue but it is fleeting and undeniable, almost reliable.



Albert our interconnected string. Thank you for the gift of bliss. Vision so timeless and elusive. The reframe. Atomic molecular structures divided... by fiction... whatever you need to believe... at least shout. Holler. Be present enough to threaten the moon in all its glory. Yes, you are enough. Embrace.

1nllvf5,What is the vibe if you can hear music coming from my studio? Are MOST Portlanders quick to call the cops or chill?,0,1758333355.0,"So I’m a touring musician for 20 years, and have had an active recording studio in Nashville for 15 years. Nashville, obviously known as Music City, has literally thousands of home studios. As long as the music is within reasonable hours, I’ve never had any problem with neighbors or noise complaints.  The studio is fairly sound proofed, but at times you’ll be able to hear amps, drums etc, from outside the house. It’s so common around here that no one has ever had a problem, and I’ve never even heard of anyone having the cops called on them for playing, recording or rehearsing bands.
The reason I ask is because my wife and I love the vibe and people so much that we’ve been looking to buy a house and move to Portland. We’re coming back in December to look around more.  One thing I’ve noticed is the neighborhoods are surprisingly quiet compared to Nashville.  I know it’s a case by case scenario (and dependent who the neighbors are).
I’m just trying to get a general consensus. If I move my studio out there, how common is it to hear bands playing? I’ve lived in a couple of towns where anytime I played drums the cops showed up, and I’m just wondering.
Again, it pretty soundproofed and not that insanely loud, and it’s never late in the evening. 
What’s the vibe? I know there is a little bit of a healthy music scene out there?

On my way home at the gas station some 60+? Man waits for me outside of the door next to my car flick his tongue at me does the V with his tongue if you know what I mean. I ignore him walk to my car get in lock the doors. He stands behind my car continuing to do the same thing. Rev My engine and yell at the window I’m gonna fucking run you down so then he walked away.

1nj2ynd,"Denied apartment fue to bad credit score, can I appeal?",0,1758081379.0,"I recently applied to one of Prometheus Apartments but got denied due to bad credit score (522). I just graduated and started an engineer role with an 82k salary, however I was self supporting myself through college, I stopped making payments on a Discover card as I couldn’t afford it and got send to collections.

 One of my parents opened a credit card with my SS without my authorization and didn’t payed it for a long time, another sibling of mine got a cell phone with my SS as well, never payed it back and went straight to collections as well. Most of my small loans have been cleared up and Im planning on paying all the remaining collections this week, asking to be removed from my credit.

The credit card from my parents got marked as delinquent but it’s closed and current now. My current credit card is at 20% but showed up in the last billing cycle as over the limit. 

I know my financial history it’s not the best but I was surviving and living mostly day to day, juggling between two jobs and my classes. I had an apartment before, the lease is still open but in my hometown, with no history of eviction but a  renter’s score of 605. 
I was given 30 days to appeal, some of the recent improvements include:

• Multiple small loans paid off in full this month (receipts available)
• Credit card utilization reduced to 30-44% (not yet reflected due to reporting cycles)
• $5k stipend from a national lab  internship arriving this week to clear remaining debt
• Stable engineering employment with full documentation

As well I am gathering the following supplemental materials for my appeal:

• Employment verification letter and supervisors recommendations
• Lab internship offer letters confirming stipend details
• Recent paystubs and payment receipts for resolved accounts
• Letter confirming incoming stipend payment, as it hasn’t arrived yet
• Updated financial statements

I made a screening deposit  and it’s not refundable, how probable is that after all of this I can get approved?
 
Just recently moved here and I’m staying at a hostal, it’s been a hard couple of weeks and I’m desperate for my own place. I tried checking air bnbs or roommates but they require stays of 3 months or more and I don’t want to be paying rent for something that is not mine:( 

I really loved the complex and the community, it’s close to my work, and friends I’ve made and it has a ton of amenities that are at reasonable price including a sauna, jacuzzi, gym, a community garden and monthly events, yoga classes and pilates every month, kamboucha on tap, and what really sold it for me was the interaction between neighbors and having a security guard that can scort me to the building or my rail stops, as I don’t have a car at the moment and I’m new to the area this made me feel really safe and no other apartment has mentioned anything like this. 
I’m making three times the rent, and besides clearing any debt, I’m offering to pay two months in advance, but it’s still f due to my poor score. Has anyone experience something like this? I still got hope that I can get approved :(",54,PortlandOR

I want to know if the car break-ins are as bad as I keep seeing on reddit.

I loved SF felt and felt safe there. The media really kept saying that SF is lawless and that everyone is in danger there even walking on the streets, which is false. However, leaving a car parked on the street overnight was a gamble there and I felt none of that today while driving in the NW of Portland, it felt pretty safe.

I would like to hear about the rates of car window smashes and break in based on local's experiences, however, I would like to avoid this post turning into a discussion of how the city is handing such occurrences.

Wondering where you can watch the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City in Portland? At Take Two on NE Killingsworth, every Tuesday at 7pm, DUH! 

WHAT: A super fun sexy silly time watching RHOSLC and playing BINGO (10% of proceeds to charity) every week! 

WHO: You + 30-50 likeminded individuals with impeccable taste + your hosts, Lisa Boehm & Rachael Young 

WHERE: Take Two, the cheekiest bar that NE Portland has to offer 

WHEN: Every Tuesday (so long as the Bravo gods provide) at 7pm. But get there early because seating is limited!

HOW MUCH: Free entry, but it’s a bar so…you know. Have a drink or two and don’t forget a snack! Might we recommend a crisp ass glass of Styring rosé and, perhaps, a large waffle fry? BINGO cards are $7 each, or 4 for $25. 

We are sooooooooooo excited to be reunited with all of our baby gorgeouses and get back to our roots with the lovely ladies of SLC

It was two different girls and both of them had an older man with them who just stood behind them as they spoke to me. The first girl came up to me downtown near pot belly’s calling me and my friend pretty and then very eagerly saying she need new friends. I noticed she was with an older man so I immediately got in my car and my friend kept talking to her and got her number. The older guy waved to me while I was sitting in the car and I just ignored him and when my friend got back in the car I told her not to text that number on a real number so she used a fake one and got these messages. The voicemail was pretty concerning I wish I could link the audio on here.

Then last night I was near voodoo donuts at the karaoke bar with the shining inspired bathroom. This time it was another girl again with an older man. I was a little buzzed so I pressed the girl a little bit more and I just kept asking questions like “how did you meet him?” “Are you okay?” I’ve seen this girl with this older man before which I also brought up because it was the same bar I had seen them at a few weeks prior. The man just stood behind her the whole time not saying a word. Both times I’ve seen them she was super messed up but I didn’t engage with her until this time. She asked to take a picture on my phone of me and my friend which I thought was odd. I noticed a phone call to a random number this morning and I’m pretty sure it was during the time of the photos she was taking. She asked for my info so I gave her an old spam account and she followed me. After looking at her second account linked in her bio it was pretty easy to see what she does for work.

A few weeks ago, Portland sent him a letter saying he owes taxes on running a business. He already paid taxes on the rental income. When he tried to call, they basically said well this is actually money owed to the county. Another person said  he has to make an online account with the city and complete a long list of forms. The letter says he only has to worry about 2020. The person said he may have to account for several years back. And on and on.

At about 1.7 miles in (where the trail makes a hairpin before going up to the fire road with a sign) I saw an animal leaving the trail headed uphill in front of me. The tricky part is that I'm not completely sure what it was but my first impression was cougar. The more I think about it the more contaminated my memory gets but this is my description: It seemed catlike not doglike and it was big but not as a big as I remember an adult cougar being. Maybe Saint Bernard sized? It had BIG paws and I thought it moved just like a cat. The only problem is it did not have that sleek coat like a cougar but was almost shaggy, reddish I think. Really don't think it was a dog, it didn't crash through the woods but slipped away. I got spooked thinking it was maybe a young cat who might still have a mother around. I stopped running, (you know, prey response etc.) and walked back out.

I can see why eyewitness testimony is shaky. If anyone knows what a bigger than a bobcat smaller than a cougar, reddish slightly shaggy, cat gait creature is please chime in.

The Procedeo contract did not result from a traditional competitive request for proposals. Instead, it is a “cooperative” contract, meaning that the firm has already won a competitive bidding process with another government entity outside of Oregon.

…

But Keisha Locklear, a senior project manager with the Office of School Modernization who has been assigned to work on Jefferson High, blasted the Texas firm. In the nearly three months of their current contract, she said, staff from Procedeo have attended only a small handful meetings, either with the entire team or individual key players, while making promises to Armstrong and other senior leaders that Locklear characterized as virtually impossible to fulfill.

His license will be suspended for 90 days, but he doesn't have to serve any time in jail. Burrell is also required to attend a victim impact panel and take a high-risk driver course.""

1ncn2k7,Videos show confrontation outside Central Library that led to alleged stabbing,83,1757434081.0,"[Link to updated article](https://katu.com/news/local/video-shows-confrontation-outside-multnomah-county-central-library-that-led-to-alleged-stabbing)

The video has been released, but doesn't have audio and doesn't seem to change the narrative all that much. It's funny how JVP's stance has changed from calling on the DA to release the video because everyone was being racist, to now saying all she was asking for was clarification on whether or not she could release the video. 

Did she contact the DA's office to ask this before trying to put him on blast? Didn't she know she could release the video, as she has done so in the past? 

Racial profiling in law enforcement and the media is a real thing. As a brown person in Portland, I'm acutely aware of how the color of my skin can affect how police and the general public perceive me. But trying to use this incident to hint at racial issues, when clearly none are present, does a great harm to the BiPOC community's efforts to raise awareness of racial inequalities. ",51,PortlandOR

1nckcn3,Establishing North/South Regional Rail,2,1757427900.0,"As someone who is from the Portland area but is going to college in Boston, it is interesting to see how the east coast cities mostly have well-established regional rail systems, but major west coast cities mostly do not. I know this is due to the time periods in which they were developed, however Portland has pretty great urbanism, and I feel as though a regional rail link running north to south could really be a big boost for the region in terms of mobility. The Max provides a decent link east/west, especially if they can figure out a solution to speeding it up downtown. There also is not any other existing infrastructure already in place to provide a faster east/west alternative via regional rail. However, there is the existing rail north/south that is already there and is used by Amtrak and obviously freight. I am curious what the barriers are to establishing initial service from Vancouver through Portland down to Oregon City or Canby? I assume that negotiating usage with the freight railroads would be difficult. There also may be considerable congestion issues. However, most stations are already built, and you could add an infill station to St. Johns. This service could then be expanded north to Kelso and south to Salem. In short, how feasible would it be to use existing rail infrastructure with minimal upgrades to quickly establish a north/south regional rail link initially from Vancouver to Oregon City with headways that would actually make the service a viable alternative to driving?",14,PortlandOR

We recently built a cedar fence and love it. Wondering if anyone has recommendations for how ***or if*** to treat it? I've heard conflicting things from neighbors - some say our weather is brutal for untreated wood and treatment is necessary for a decent lifetime, others say no treatment will withstand our climate anyways and if you treat it it'll need to be re-treated every 3-5 years otherwise the treatment will not only look bad but actually accelerate degradation, so best leave it raw and let nature run its course.   
We don't mind it going grey, just want it to last as long as reasonably possible in our Portland climate!   
I'm also very averse to toxic products, so any sort of carcinogenic or unsafe, unhealthy, or otherwise dangerous, nasty stuff is not an option.

1nbtpjh,One Week Left to Give Input on Portland's Ranked-Choice Elections!,37,1757351737.0,"September 8, 2025

In the 2024 General Election, Portlanders elected their mayor, auditor, and city councilors using ranked-choice voting for the first time. The City’s 2024 election saw 118 candidates qualified to the ballot, resulting in as many as 30 candidates in a single contest.

Having a large pool of candidates for voters to select from to represent the City is a good problem to have. However, findings from post-election data and public feedback demonstrated that the high number of candidates caused various challenges, including:

* Some voters felt overwhelmed
* Some voters skipped contests because they felt uninformed about the candidates
* Candidates struggled to get resources for their campaigns
* Candidates had a hard time reaching voters with crowded forums and events

# Gathering public feedback

The Elections Division is reviewing the candidate filing fee and related policies. Before moving forward with a plan, we want to know what options Portlanders prefer, and how they experienced the first ranked choice voting election.

Please complete the following two-minute survey to indicate which policy you most support and give us your feedback. We are also looking to gather information from this short survey on the best ways to engage with Portlanders in the future.

Learn more about these policy changes and take our two-minute survey on our website: [www.portland.gov/vote/improve](https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.portland.gov%2Fvote%2Fimprove%3Futm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/010101992a4c64e3-21043004-ef4e-4577-bdc5-d29f6c187c6c-000000/53RI-mU7rWN-HqAI56yINrUSZCZmREk3xoVSt_v1SO4=421)",51,PortlandOR

No one who writes these articles must ever ride from airport to downtown or convention center.

A few airport workers on train leaving PDX. After that stop everyone who got on with shopping carts and trash bags and clearly high or mentally ill. Talking to themselves or shouting. No fares were checked and unlike mass transit in every other major city, the stations are not secured. No fare required to loiter station. From NE 60th stop to downtown hillside covered with massive amounts of trash and every bit of concrete covered with graffiti. At Hollywood stop someone had urinated on the HOP card machine.

We are inviting you to participate in an experiment about effects of lighting on people's wellbeing. You'll visit our laboratory in Sellwood for two hours every week over a span of five weeks and you'll be paid with a gift card for your contribution.

**We are especially looking for people with migraines as we hope to improve LED lighting for everyone.** We have a medical doctor assess questionnaire responses to mitigate severe risks to people with migraines. We also provide a dark room, where people can rest and sit comfortably, and we will have water and snacks!

If you are interested, please read the flyer below, and contact Alfiya Orman ( [alfiya.ormanova@pnnl.gov](mailto:alfiya.ormanova@pnnl.gov) ). Let me know if you have any question and we hope to see you!

How about Instead of squeezing more money out of people with parking fees, how about enforcing the leash laws that already exist—especially in places downtown and parks? Put those ticket writers in the parks and start fining people who let their dogs run off-leash.

This isn't just about dog haters. It's about safety, accountability, and respect for public spaces. Responsible dog owners *want* leash laws enforced just as much as people with allergies, small children, or nervous dogs do.

The only ones who will complain are the ones breaking the rules. If you're serious about generating revenue, stop ignoring the blatant violations happening every day in the parks.

So I get the lock 'em for a longer lease bit but could you at least mention oh yes er..there are 10, 11  and 12 month leases too..but we wont mention that part..

Anyway I will be saying to them nice try with only mentioning 15 month term or month to month..what are the other lease length choices ? 

BUT what’s going on in the market these days? Rent prices cooling? More vacancies? I never miss a payment. I am really quiet. I want to negotiate a fair price for my new lease. And what is the rent cap  these days? 10%? 

What is your tactic for negotiating a good deal? Appreciate your time!

1n8mh0s,I need legal advice? rental office “lost” my mothers rent money,8,1757020586.0,"Okay sorry in advance I’m typing this quickly on my break.. let’s start at the beginning so my mom and I live in an low income apartment complex we have lived here for 10 plus years we went to purchase a money order for the rent as we usually do around the beginning of the month. That month the rental office was closed for the weekend (this happened in May of this year) was closed we have till the 5th to pay its was Saturday the 3rd because my mom is a worry wart she insisted on paying it before so we wouldn’t get charged with a late fee. So since the office was closed we had the option to drop the money order in the drop box attached to the main office. I personally never liked the idea of the drop box because I was worried it would get stolen. Over the years since we’ve lived here we’ve heard of similar incidents on the office management losing or misplacing checks etc. from the Dropbox. A month or so had passed and we continued buying money orders and paying our rent as usual taking them to the office in person and getting a copy taken and signed. Sometime later we received a non payment eviction notice stating that we never payed the month of May. We went to figure out what happened with the manager and they told us that month they had “problems” with said Dropbox and other tenants had similar issues with their checks missing. 

We gave them our records/receipts proving that we did in fact purchase the money orders. We asked them if there was camera footage but they said that their cameras are too blurry or couldn’t film that far. They said they would do their best to track the money orders and to see if it was paid to another account and we left it at that. Time passes and we don’t hear anything back until we receive another non payment notice again. This time I go with my sister to investigate further I go to the customer service counter where I purchased the money order to see if there was any way to track it and they refer me to the company that does the actual transaction of money orders. I search up the tracking information and it says that the money order was cashed in July. I go back to the apartment complex office and show them the screenshot and the money order tracking information again and they tell me that they are going to continue looking into it. More time passes we hear nothing back until for the third time we receive another nonpayment notice again. We meet with the manager of our apartment complex and we contact the money order company and they tell us that the money order was changed and later cashed on July 20th. They don’t give us any other information but tell us to file a police report and a fraudulent report to the money order company.

Basically what I want to know is will still have to pay that rent even if the money order was stolen/“misplaced” from their property I say misplaced obviously because the money order was changed and got cashed so it definitely got stolen…like is it still on us or on them because they give off the vibe of not wanting to take responsibility because they won’t tell us what “problem” they had with the dropbox.It just feels fishy or sketchy I guess. I also want to add that our management has changed a few times throughout this year we had a lot of temporary management staff coming in and out and I believe that some other staff were fired around the time this incident happened. This has been stressful af and having this whole back and forth is just frustrating because we aren’t getting anywhere.So do I just have to keep waiting after I filed a police report and filed a report to the money order company so I guess my other question is but if they don’t catch whoever did this will we still have to pay? What else can we do? ",2,PortlandOR
1n8lsxd,Service charges,56,1757019005.0,"Hi, I am a server at a restaurant on the water front called Il terrazzo. I want some advice about something that is troubling me. They implemented a service charge last fall. You’d think I would love it but I actually hate it and here is why:

The main reason is that the owners are taking a portion of it. There is no law in Oregon at least that prevents the owners from using a service to cover operational costs and sharing it with the managers. They are phrasing the service charge is a pooled house, gratuity, and as a tip. This is misleading and false advertising. I wouldn’t mind the service charge as much if they properly disclosed how it was used and said something about paying a living wage or the high cost of operating in Portland or something like that. The service charge+tip is actually lower than tips without the service charge used to be. You would think it would increase it because it would eliminate ppl who would tip low but that has not happened. They have to remove it if people ask even if they have no complaints about the service. We get in trouble if we don’t tell people even though it’s on the menu, reciept, and website. They will refund the tip if you contact them after saying you didn’t realize it was there. The regulars who used to be 22-23% tippers now don’t tip because of the service charge. I only get 25% of the service charge compared to what I put in the tip pool. The other 75% gets split between the host, kitchen, management, and support. We only have a bartender 1x or 2x a week we don’t have bussers or runners so I am doing everything myself. I have gotten in trouble and they have threatened to fire me for telling customers exactly how much of the service charge I get and where it gets distributed to. With the extra money they are taking we don’t have good benefits. We don’t have healthcare. We don’t have a 401k. The extra money isn’t being used to benefit us. I have talked to my manager about my troubles and the customers complaints and he said it’s not going anywhere. He said they wouldn’t change the verbiage. He argued that because it’s a service charge they can use it however they want. Then also argued that it is a tip. But legally and from a tax perspective service charges are not tips and tips can’t go to ownership/management. I actually wouldn’t mind sharing tips with the assistant managers if they had a separate login when working the floor. I shouldn’t be sharing tips with someone doing administrative work or making the final decisions. I would also be happy if they used the extra money for healthcare benefits ect instead of using it for operational costs and paying their managers. The problem is that they are using the service charge to benefit the owners and not the employees but from a customer perspective it appears that it’s benefiting the employees but that isn’t true

I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not just my restaurant that is the issue. Lots of restaurants in the area do this. It’s also a legal matter and that they need to make the law about service charges more clear. Currently they only have to disclose that there is a service charge on the receipt and somewhere else in the restaurant. I think the law needs to be updated so that the verbiage describing it is accurate so new hires and customers can make informed decisions. Another option would be to remove the service charge entirely. However one job removing it won’t stop other places from doing the same thing which is why I think the law needs to be more clear.

You might just say get a new job. The problem is the economy. I have 5 years of serving/bartending experience. It took about 300 applications, 30 interviews, and 3 months to get this job. The same can be said for any other qualified person that doesn’t have a connection to use. The only people getting jobs easily are the people with connections. People want to hire people they already know.

I have already contacted boli but there is a strong chance they won’t investigate this or it won’t end in a positive outcome. There was a similar case where they investigated another company and the company refused to give the money back when boli asked. They decided it wasn’t worth litigation and said they needed to approach it as a civil lawsuit. There hasn’t been any updates since.

I am looking into lawyers potentially but I think the odds of winning are low because of the grey area within the law.

What are other solutions? Would regular people / customers be willing to help? Maybe the news? Is this something people would find worth protesting for? Leave ur thoughts below",47,PortlandOR

1ntp3q5,"Photos + Timeline: Why Portland’s ICE Building Is Boarded Up, and Why It’s Peaceful Today",291,1759168736.0,"I love seeing all the pictures people are posting from around the city, showing how peaceful and, frankly, beautiful Portland was this weekend. That’s great for people to see when they’re coming here to learn what’s up with the National Guard conversation. I haven’t seen a post that provides more context though, so I thought I’d try to put things in perspective.

Since early summer 2025, local advocates have accused ICE of unlawfully holding detainees longer than city permits allow, and have held protests at Portland’s field office. Tensions peaked on June 14, when a large demonstration escalated into property damage and was declared a riot by Portland Police; federal agents used crowd-control munitions and soon after boarded up the building’s windows and doors to prevent further break-ins and vandalism. That’s why the pictures of the ICE HQ show the building boarded up. But these events concluded more than 100 days ago.

In September, the City of Portland, following its own investigation, issued a land-use violation notice to the facility, citing both the prolonged detentions and the unpermitted exterior boarding, reinforcing claims of administrative wrongdoing by ICE. Since the June clash, the scene has been calm: for the past two months, only a handful of protesters, typically five to ten people, have maintained a quiet, sign-holding vigil outside the heavily fortified facility, with the only documented confrontations involving occasional shoves or verbal threats from federal officers rather than demonstrators.

I took pictures of the city from Trinity Episcopal downtown, where I started, to the ICE HQ off the South Waterfront. I only stopped twice: once at Petunia’s for a Pistachio Sticky Bun, and at the Blue Star Donuts for an Apple Brandy Crumble donut. The Blue Star location is a six-minute walk from the facility and was full. Elizabeth Caruther’s Park across the street was filled with children playing.  My pictures, where you see fewer than 10 protestors holding signs and quietly waving at cars, were taken at 1 PM yesterday.

I also saw a woman reading at the park while drinking a smoothie. Not long after, 2 joggers stopped nearby for a gluten free bagel that was delicious but also reasonably priced.

1nsykhl,How Portland's violent crime rate compares to other similarly sized US cities,121,1759090884.0,"Hey everyone,

For a while now as a resident I've wondered how Portland's violent crime compares to similar US cities. My casual glancing at tables here and there always suggested Portland was quite safe, but I wanted a slightly more rigorous analysis using FBI data.

I used the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), which provides more detailed crime categories than the traditional UCR. While NIBRS doesn't cover every US city, all of the cities with similar population participate in the program.

I picked out the ~15 or so US cities closest to Portland's population, downloaded their NIBRS data, and wrote a Python script to analyze and rank them by safety. I put the totals near the left because Reddit tables are obnoxious, particularly on phones.

**Data limitations:**

• The rape rate is suspiciously low in El Paso for this data - I wonder if there was a reporting issue here because that number just doesn't seem correct

• This doesn't include property crime, although I think that's pretty sensible considering anything on these lists is far worse than getting your car broken into

• Population density varies significantly across these cities and is arguably more relevant than total population

• Economic and demographic factors aren't accounted for

• Crime reporting rates differ between cities due to varying community and police behaviors

• Simply totaling crime categories treats murder and intimidation equally, which is clearly problematic (though assigning weights would introduce subjective bias)

• This uses 2024 data; complete 2025 data isn't available yet

• I had trouble with getting the correct data for Vegas so it's not on this list even though it's similar in size

**Closing Thoughts**

Unsurprisingly for me as a resident, Portland OR feels pretty safe. This is especially true when you look at the more expanded data where Portland is ranked 2nd safest amongst cities similar in size in the US.

Please flag any errors you spot - I'm happy to correct them.

If you would like to see more cities in an easily accessible place, Wikipedia maintains a [comprehensive list of US cities by crime rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_crime_rate) using FBI UCR data, though its size makes population-based comparisons more difficult, and UCR isn't quite as complete as NIBRS.

Here's the link for the FBI's NIBR data which is pretty overwhelming. There are lots of aggregators out there:

That said, I'm not trying to downplay the actions here. It's blatantly unconstitutional and authoritarian whether the deployment of federal troops is carried out.

Didn't answer a single question I came in with.

Now my other kitten is having significant issues with her appetite and they're just not concerned. Getting them to treat a situation with any urgency has been impossible and I'm just over it.

Anyway, I'm looking for a new vet clinic where the vets are knowledgeable about cats. They would ideally be in/near NW or at least easy to get to via a single bus (I'm right by the 15, 24, and 77 lines). I'd like a clinic that can accommodate same day urgent appointments, since it's one of the few reasons I've stuck with my current vet.

Lastly, I'd just like my pets and I to be treated with empathy and compassion. I know a lot of people in vet med are burned out and I truly empathize, but I'm just a human who worries about my babies when they're sick.

I was unemployed for a period of time and going back to school during 2006-2007.

Rick Emerson was so funny and they just talked about random stuff and celebrity news.  I ended up going back to work in April, 2007, and shortly afterwards, the show was cancelled.  I have no idea what happened to Rick Emerson, and am surprised he didn't show up on another radio station to lead a morning show (or maybe he moved to a different city).

My roomie/best friend and I are planning our move to Portland next summer. That seems like a ways out, but we're moving across the country and have some other logistical things to work out, so I've been trying to get organized/get our budgets aligned. 

If we were able to rent an apartment, I wouldn't be stressed about housing at all. But we have two noisy little old rescue dogs, and I really don't want to be constantly anxious and shushing them with too many shared walls. So we're looking for a single-family home, MAYBE a townhome or a duplex, depending on the layout/build/if we could sequester them away from a shared wall when we're gone. 

Realistically, we have a pretty long runway. We don't have to be out of our house until August and are planning to start looking in April or May, since we could swing two rents if it were only for a couple of months. But I just learned about the first-come, first-served law and have been monitoring the rental sites to see how quickly things get snapped up. 

With all that context, Has anyone used a rental broker for a long-distance move? I understand that we're likely still going to need to apply ourselves, but I'm trying to think of any way to make the house-hunting process simpler. My thought is that one might be helpful if we were trying to plan a week or two in Portland for house hunting, possibly serving as an aggregator of open houses we should be touring and submitting to. Maybe that's wishful thinking. 

I know somebody is going to tell us to just do a short-term rental. If we absolutely have to, we will, but I have pretty severe allergies and work from home, so being able to control the furniture/textiles in my environment is really important.

We re-entered at the same time. You held the door, I said sorry, and you hit me with the smoothest “After you, ma’am.” (Ma’am? Polite and mysterious? I was intrigued.)  
  
We walked down the hallway together, and I had a million questions swirling in my head—like, what’s your high score? Do you always wear cool shoes? Are you secretly a pinball champion? But instead, I watched you head straight back to your machine like a man on a mission.

1nt8y39,I just rescued my first dog and I think he was previously abused. Does anyone have any advice?,14,1759120429.0,"Hi all! 
I just rescued a dog yesterday and it happened very quickly. I’ve been looking for a while but wasn’t expecting it to happen that day. Anyways, he is a super sweet, 3 year old mini poodle mix. I’ve never rescued before, I’ve only had experience with my parents’ dogs from breeders so this is very new to me. I want to train him using positive reinforcement for sure. I do think he was abused—he’s very skiddish and if he comes up to me, I gently and slowly put my hand out for him to sniff and he winces like I’m going to hit him. It makes me so sad. I only engage if he shows me he wants me to.

I’m showing him love on his terms, patience and giving him treats to encourage him (which he unfortunately rarely takes at the moment). I know it will take time for him to decompress, feel comfortable, and feel at home, but since I’ve never rescued a dog before, I want to make sure I’m doing all the right things and not traumatizing him in any way. He’s had quite a few accidents in the house despite walks. I live in an apartment complex with a small patio. I did get a grass pad for him but he still hasn’t figured out it’s for going potty and not laying down lol. I do have a crate set up for him and keep the door open if he wants to go in it and he has a few times.

I do work full time and am planning on getting a dog walker for him initially and then once he feels more comfortable, I would like to bring him to a doggie daycare. Does anyone have any recommendations for the following:
1. Training including crate training and potty training
2. Dog walker
3. Doggie daycare

I live in the Buckman area/central southeast Portland. Any other recommendations or tips for anything else are also welcome. Thanks so much!

1nt0l25,Live in NW/Downtown Portland or live a 10-15min drive from downtown?,0,1759095829.0,"So I'm moving to Portland soon, and I can't decide where to live. I'm coming from Medford, OR, and I've been daydreaming about walking in walkable neighborhoods/downtown areas, getting coffee etc... but I'm apartment searching on a budget. So I'm looking mostly at 1 bedrooms under $1300/mo.

Anyways, I've found a few options with some options in the NW/Alphabet district, a few just outside downtown lines next to PSU, and some that are in the Multnomah Village area. 

The best bang for my buck option I found is a 1bd 1bath apt 580sq/ft with 1 parking spot included for $1100/mo in the Multnomah Village area (10-15mins from downtown). After that there's apt options next to PSU just outside downtown lines for around $1200/mo with 500sq/ft and street permit parking. Last is NW/Alphabet district apartment options at $1300/mo to live in a smaller 400-500sq/ft apartment, but walkability is amazing. Street parking is more risky for break-ins here, though.

Anyways, is the walkable neighborhood in NW worth the extra $200/mo in costs? Or would it not feel like I miss anything from living a 10-minute drive away from downtown?

I 100% want my car, so I have to take into account parking costs. Would a middle-ground location, like being close to PSU, but not directly in a walkable neighborhood, be a good option? I also work 100% remote, which is why the size of the apt is a concern for me.

I get that I can only know what I really want for myself, but I want your opinions on how you feel about that trade-off personally. I mean, what I really want is to be able to afford a 1 bd at $1500-1600/mo & apt parking costs in NW or Pearl area, but I'm a year off from that at the minimum.",36,askportland

should say this is the first time I'd been to this theater!  i'd never been to any McMenamins property, and I didn't know anything about their history/marketing/mythology prior.

this is also the first time in my life i've ever had an experience with something that appeared to be a ghost.

\*\*

Just got home from the late showing of *One Battle After Another* (it's good - I recommend).  The showing started at 10:45 and this film has an almost 3 hour running time, so it was over around 2 a.m.  I went by myself and sat in the middle of the theater on the floor level.  I usually watch a film until the credits are totally over, so am typically the last person there.

But this time, as the credits rolled, I could hear floor sweeping that sounded like it was right behind me.

I kept watching the credits for a bit, but figured the person working there was trying to give me a hint, so I stood up to leave before the credits were done....

...and there was no one there.  No usher, nobody with a broom.  The sound of sweeping had also stopped.  My first thought was to ask an employee if the place was haunted, but I didn't see a single soul in the theater, nor in the lobby, as I walked out.

I guess it's possible that the acoustics could've just been crazy and maybe the usher was sweeping up in the balcony and it somehow sounded like it was a row or two directly behind me....but how?

\*\*

Googled it right away and the internet says the theater is widely considered to be haunted, and the most prominent spirit is a former maintenance person.

It didn't feel threatening or anything - I actually tried to talk to it a little as I stood there.  It seems spookier now that I'm home.

Any advice on dealing with PGE? I called and they told me to set up a payment plan.

Edit: This is not related to my solar installation. I can confirm without any doubt whatsoever there was NO solar generation before the meter swap on the 22nd, and that meter swap is why the billing cycle ended on the 21st.
The Enphase gateway was installed prior to the billing cycle, and the Enphase app clearly shows there was no power generated or exported during that month. It also clearly shows only 1.3mwh consumed for the month. And even if it was due to power being exported? They are charging me for more than a year of power in one month. My solar system is designed for LESS than that over an entire year. It's not going to do it a month.

This is not an issue with my electrical, not an issue with my solar, and if it was an issue with the meter it's too late to confirm because that meter is gone.

Person applied for the HRSN grant in November 2024 and again in December 2024. 

Received a formal eviction notice January 7 2025. Was accepted for the grant on January 14 2025

Letter was sent stating I was accepted for 6 months of paid rent and 6 months of utilities. 

Lawyers officer and property management did not return phone calls or connect in any way by cure by date, in fact could not get ahold of them at all until court April 16. 

Told the judge and court that HRSN was promised, here is the letter from Care Oregon. 

They still did not pay. Persons heavily advocated through every avenue to get help, there was no help. 

Reached out to multiple organizations to help with rent, but they said they couldn’t help until the grant paid because the amount that is needed is too much to help with. 

Trial date was set for June 2nd 2025. Person could not afford an attorney. Person now owes 39,000$ in back rent to property management HRSN still didn’t pay, nor could there be help with.

Person was evicted from their home of 5 years on July 1st, and now owes more money than they make in a year. 

Person now has ruined credit, an eviction on their record, a repossessed car, and their name has been absolutely tarnished as well for something that they relied on the state to do. 

They have reached out to basically every free resource like:

OHA
Care Oregon
HRSN hold line for hours at a time, only to be hung up on.
Oregon state bar 
community alliance of tenants 
Oregon law center 
211
Clear clinic
Metropolitan Public Defenders 

But a lot of them have conflict of interest because it’s a program through OHP care Oregons they’ve been told. 

Any help yall have would be great, I’m just the messenger but I genuinely feel for this person and am wanting to help them the best I can.

I’d love to kind of grow with a young artist and get a collection of their work on myself. I’m hoping to find someone who is open to doing an art trade, as well. I’m an established ceramic artist and would be open to discussing some kind of meaningful trade that we both could feel good about, customs or otherwise. Might any of you be my next tattoo artist?",0,askportland

1npm4ws,Tips for visiting at the end of the year?,0,1758743479.0,"Hi! My wife and I are planning on visiting Portland between Christmas and New Years to do a little neighborhood scouting, as we are hoping to move to your city next year. We stayed in Portland for a few days way back in 2015, and fell in love with the city. We’ve talked about moving there ever since, and are now in a position where we can pull the trigger.

Ideally we’d like to stay in a somewhat central neighborhood with good MAX access - I had thought Kerns but maybe closer to Downtown/the Pearl? We won’t have a car and want to get around as much as possible using public transit. 

The plan is basically to spend a day in each quadrant (sextant?), eating, drinking, and doing as the locals do, but also to envision what it would really be like to live there full time. I’m compiling a list of places we’ll try to hit in each area, and attempt to cram in as much as we can over the 4 or 5 days we’ll be there. I know there’s no shortage of world-class restaurants and cool, unique shops, so the focus will be more on getting a vibe check for the neighborhoods, what commuting would look like, etc. 

How dead should we expect the city to be? I know things tend to slow down in that period between Christmas and New Years generally, but I don’t know how much that applies in Portland specifically. Do a lot of smaller businesses close up shop? Does the city “empty out” noticeably as people go to visit family or stay in for a few days? As an example, we love pub trivia and would ideally be able to stop in somewhere to play one of the nights we’re in town — should we expect a lot of them to be off that week?

Any insights (or recommendations for places to check out!) would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",21,askportland

I saw some other hunters, and some with dogs. None of the dogs seemed on to anything. No hunters had a bird in hand. I heard maybe 5 distant shots during that time. Any tips for how I can be better at this? I have the week off, and will hunt until Friday morning. I've literally NEVER gotten anything in two years of hunting (all sorts of game). I didn't learn this from my family, I'm new. It would be SO NICE to finally get a bird or ANYTHING at all. Please anyone, if you know how to get game on Sauvie Island, don't hold out on me.

I organize a meetup for former educators and teachers transitioning (or considering transitioning) into a new industry/career. This is something I do off the clock every 2 months or so - as a former teacher myself - to build community and help connect folks to each other, to resources, and share stories and opportunities. It’s a tough job market out there and for those who may have only worked in education or been in the industry for a long time, it can be a really difficult shift. 

I’m looking for a space on the east side and centrally-located where we can hold our October meetup. Somewhere where folks can gather open house style from 6-8pm on a Wednesday evening to connect over food/drink. 

This has proven tough because I have no budget as a solo organizer. Specifically, I need to find a place that: 
- allows me to reserve table space for about 15 people without a fee
- doesn’t have a food & beverage minimum
- allows people to just have their own tab
- is indoors, unless there’s a covered and heated patio.

Original post- Concerts are stressful. I’ve been to my fair share in my teenage years (warped tour, crowded messes at the Hawthorne and Wonder Ballroom), and decided that concerts just weren’t something I wanted to do anymore.

Something came over me, however, and I convinced myself to go to a concert at the moda center next month. I’ve never attended a show at a venue this large and I have NO idea what to expect. For those of you who are seasoned pros, I’d love to hear from you! 

How early do you get there? How bad is the parking? Is it better to park elsewhere and get an uber to take you there? 

If the lines are long, is most of the waiting done outside? Just trying to plan in case the weather is bad. 

We know our section and row, but not the seat number. Is that assigned closer to the event date or do all the people assigned to that row just fight over who sits where? 

Do you pass through metal sensors? I have a lot of orthopedic hardware and I don’t want to set off the detectors and jeopardize my ability to attend.

1n7n4rs,Apartment building and neighborhood recommendations,0,1756924829.0,"I'm considering a move to Portland and was hoping people could chime in on some recommendations for apartment buildings, property management companies, and neighborhoods. I am planning to visit the area to check things out, but I'd like to have a starting point for where to scout out when I head up there. I've included a little about me and listed what I'm looking for below, so if places you are recommending meet these, or are missing some, please feel free to share what might be included/excluded. Thanks in advance for all the help!

About me
Mid 30's guy. LGBT identifying. Like to participate in various adult recreational sports/leagues and social events. Looking for somewhere that is walkable and social but doesn't necessarily need to be right in the middle of everything. An area where people are friendly or if there is a good meeting spot to socialize would be nice since I won't know many people if I make the move.

Budget
- Ideally I would like to be at $1500 or less. Not necessarily the lower the better, but trying to be reasonable while meeting my higher priority items below.

Amenities
Higher priority amenities I would like on my wish list
- 1 bedroom (large studio could possibly work depending on layout and square footage)
- 575+ sq feet (I work remote so need some room for my desk and normal living)
- W/D in unit (if not in unit then onsite at minimum)
- Parking spot available/included (covered preferably)
- A/C
- Onsite fitness center/gym (not a requirement but would love it)
- A building that doesn't need a lot of repairs (ex: not turning off water every other week for repairs)

Medium priority amenities that would be nice to have
- Bike parking or storage
- Dishwasher
- Secure/gated entry
- Something with a view that's not just facing another building or wall would be nice
- Community/apartment events/socials to meet people/neighbors
- Swimming Pool and/or hot tub

Location
- Walkable neighborhood to park(s), grocery store, coffee shop, and a few social bars to meet people.
- Safe area

Please feel free to share any and all recommendations, links to apartment complex websites or property management websites you recommend, etc. I would plan on visiting in the next two months or so and moving early next year. Thanks again everyone!",11,PDX

1mzv9lo,Huge thank you to area soccer refs!,7,1756139358.0,"While temperatures this weekend soared to 100º, the annual Summer Slam tournament took place across Portland, Vancouver and Camas. Many of these matches occur on turf where temps can be as much as 40º higher than the air temperature. While players can sub out and get in front of a fan, get more water, get a cold wash cloth, etc... The refs are out there on the pitch at a constant for the entire match, and matches are back-to-back-to-back-to-back. We saw multiple refs experiencing heat exhaustion causing other refs to have to race across town and officiate ""one more match"". We even had a situation where a match had to start late and our ref officiated the whole match well after sundown on an unlit field. The kids could see, but the old parent eyes could only see a white ball and boots.

Somehow, in all of this, we still have parents on the side lines that feel fit to audibly criticize these referees despite the fact that the game simply cannot happen without them.

So here's to you refs. I know it's not the pay that brings you out.  Your love for the game enables you to put up with the heat and the bullshit so that these kids can love this game the way you do. We appreciate you.",0,PDX

I could see lots of orange, and it looked like it was dripping flaming  material.  The dripping effect must have been caused by the way it was crumbling apart, rather than something more sudden.

I am posting this to request any cell phone video of a security incident that occurred at C C slaughters on July 19 around 9:30 PM. This request is of my own accord and is not requested by any of the parties involved.

Two friends of mine went to cc slaughters on July 19. When one of them (a person of color) went to order a drink, the bartender made it incorrectly. When she politely corrected him, he flipped out and told her that he was going to call security and call the cops on her. She backed away from him slowly and joined my other friend, her girlfriend. Before they knew it two security guards , scooped my friend up from behind each arm, and told her that she needed to leave. While dragging her out of the bar. Once outside, they pinned her to the ground. Her girlfriend, was understandably very distraught. She, as well as a good Samaritan, who saw the entire incident, tried to stop security from continuing to assault her. When the police came, they arrested, my friend who was pinned by security, my other friend (her girlfriend), as well as the good Samaritan. 

The cops claim they saw bar’s security footage of my friend, punching the security guards, but that simply isn’t true. Multiple witnesses saw that she was being dragged or pinned the entire time completely helpless. I looked at her hands myself, and there are no injuries to indicate that she punched somebody multiple times. She does however have multiple injuries to her head and neck from being assaulted by the security guards. 

My friends are getting an attorney, but we are fearful that the security footage will “disappear” when the bar closes down. Please if you were there that night. And you witnessed this incident and even better if you took cell phone video DM me.

I'm in the early stages of a documentary project about Portland's cable access television scene during the 1980s and 90s and ***I need your help***!

**Some context about the project:**

* I'm exploring how cable access TV during this time period reflected Portland's unique culture and provided space for creative expression.
* I'm currently looking at shows like Jim Spagg, The Chess Show, Insanity, Where's the Art, but interested in ALL cable access programming from this period.
* Currently investigating themes of free expression, censorship challenges, how marginalized communities used this platform, and the preservation efforts happening today
* I'm interested in documenting the history and legacy of community media in PDX

**I'm hoping to connect with:**

* People who created or worked on cable access shows
* Viewers who regularly watched or called in
* Staff who worked at the stations/facilities
* Anyone with archives, recordings, or memorabilia
* Those who remember how cable access impacted Portland's communities

**If you or someone you know was part of this scene, I'd love to hear:**

* What shows do you remember watching or creating?
* Any memorable moments, episodes, or personalities?
* How did cable access reflect Portland's culture at that time?
* Do you have any recordings, photos, or materials from that era?
* How did your experience with cable access impact you?

This is a passion project aimed at preserving this unique piece of Portland's media history before memories and materials are lost to time. I'm particularly interested in how cable access television provided a platform for voices and perspectives that weren't represented in mainstream media.

Feel free to comment below or DM me if you'd prefer to share privately. I'm happy to chat over coffee with anyone who has stories to share!

I lived in Gresham and then closer to downtown for my stint there, so anywhere between those two spots is okay. Just looking for somewhere on the safer side. I’ll be renting a car, so neighborhoods with some okay parking is appreciated.

Photos are attached of the tall young man in the ski mask. He was also one of the attackers that gave most of the blows to my nephews head. HIS NAME IS CORDELL AND HE GOES TO ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL.

The girl with the blue headband is the “ringleader” female of the group of students that antagonized and attacked my nephew goes by the last name Spencer. She is most likely an 8th grader at George Middle School. Her father possibly last named Spencer was also present during a shakedown that occurred at the park on Friday 4/18 that also involved my nephew being intimidated by this grown adult, he was also in a face covering and red baseball cap which is very disturbing. He is allegedly a boxer (as said by the  antagonizing female).

Location: Burr Ave at George Park playground.

Date/time: 4/21 between 3:30pm and 4:15pm

PPB Case # 25-103022

Police and schools are AWARE…

Today my 15 year-old nephew with Autism Spectrum Disorder was attacked by 7 students. At least 1 from Roosevelt and the others from George. They broke his phone and stole his cash. 

He had been hit repeatedly in the head by one student and has huge red marks on his inner arm and is sore on other various parts of his body.
He’s processing the incident and I’ll provide any more info when I can.

Please if anyone has any footage of 2 females and  5 males of different races walking NORTH toward Fessenden. 

The police have been notified and all surrounding schools know everything.

Thank you in advance for any help.

1jigcph,Are there any companies that accept teens with only a highschool graduate and only 5 previous jobs?,8,1742782657.0,"Hi! I'm so sorry if this isn't a good place to ask, or is a stretch to ask for, but I'm at a loss right now. 

I just graduated highschool last summer and had been trying to find work, I had a job but it was only seasonal and I was let go after 3 months. I've been trying to find a new one and have applied quite literally every business with a career page, or application options, that I could find. Not a single store will except me because I don't have enough customer service experience, and food places won't take me either because I'm over qualified (I still got no clue what that means honestly.) 
No matter where I apply to, I hear nothing back from the application. I'm a little fearful to keep finding fast food places to apply to in Portland because my disability affects my ability to walk really long distances, and I live in Hillsboro, I don't know if any fast food places far from me would be willing to accept me long term because of me having medical episodes. 

My last job was a warehouse one, I tried looking for other jobs like it close to me since I walk, take the max, and bus places, however I only find places asking for a degree in something for lots of experience. 

I've worked at a radio station and a clinic as an intern, and was a full time nanny between ages 13 - 15 in foster care where I had to administer medication and watch over the kids while the parents left often. The same time I also baby sat occasionally so I'd have extra money. 

I haven't found a single place willing to take me that normal teens go for, so I was going to try finding either remote jobs, or companies that are also warehouse, or things that tie into experience I already have such as event planning when i was with the radio station. 
I was hoping, if my past jobs and disabilities disqualify me from most retail and customer service jobs, if I could find at least something in line of what I've done before so hopefully they'd take me. 

Does anyone know of any jobs that would accept a work history like this, or a woman with only a highschool diploma and disabilities? I will take any job that has a chance at accepting me, as long as it's within 1 1/2 - 2 hour commute since I'd be walking and taking the max most of the way. 

I'm really sorry if this question is really redundant as well, I'm just really struggling and unsure where to go if most teenage accepting jobs aren't accepting my applications, I don't know where to go. 

I also apologize for any spelling errors or if the way I word things was weird, or if i rambled a little too much, I haven't slept in days trying to find some sort of job and stressing over it. My father is also out of work and I was the one bringing in money at my last job, so I'm stressing trying to find something that pays at least a little over minimum wage so I can keep us afloat until he finds something. 

Thank you so much for reading.

1idcbrj,"If Multnomah County Won't Act on Crime, Let’s Make Them!",0,1738205340.0,"I wanted to share something I’ve been thinking about regarding property crime in our community and what I believe the county should do to address it. Over the years, Multnomah County has drastically cut its jail capacity, leaving many empty jail beds and insufficient funding for our district attorney’s office to go after criminals meaningfully. This is having a direct impact on our neighborhood's safety. You see it posted here almost every day or week. Fr.

The sad truth is that while county officials seem to express concern about the crime happening, they haven't really prioritized addressing it in the ways we need, like focusing on appropriate policing, prosecution, and putting consequences in place for those committing property crimes. That’s why I’m proposing a new initiative called the Accountability for Property Crime Initiative. Working Title at the moment.

This initiative is designed to hold county leaders accountable by providing a 'Crime Victim Compensation Fund' to help property crime victims. The way things are now if your car gets broken into or your bike gets stolen, the inconvenience is bad enough. But if someone’s job depends on their car or their livelihood relies on their bike, that impact is devastating. The same goes for small business owners dealing with constant break-ins and vandalism. This proposal would help them directly by providing compensation for crime victims and helping those who are struggling with these issues.

Here’s what the proposal would do:

1. **County Charter Amendment**: This would ensure that the charter takes precedence over other ordinances and cannot be changed without a vote of the people.
2. **Victim Compensation**: The County would pay victims up to $2,500 per occurrence, and claims would need to be processed within 60 days, at least until crime levels return to pre-pandemic levels.
3. **Crime Victim's Office**: It would create a dedicated office to handle victim claims, similar to the one a commercial insurance company has.
4. **Incentivized County Action**: The county would be incentivized to pursue criminals to recover the payouts made to victims.
5. **No New Taxes**: The program would be funded by the County, but it **can’t raise taxes.** This would likely push the County to prioritize funds and make necessary budget cuts in less essential areas.

This initiative would create real change and force the County to act for the people most affected by crime. It could also encourage the County to reopen and expand jail space, leading to fewer repeat offenders committing crimes while waiting for trial.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this idea. It seems like we can solve our problem... Multnomah Counties problem and help figure out this mess.

**TL;DR: Multnomah County's inaction on property crime negatively impacts everyday people. A new proposal would establish a victims’ compensation fund, providing up to $2,500 for losses until crime rates improve. This initiative would compel the county to create more jail space and hold criminals accountable while avoiding tax increases. The aim: motivate county leaders to address the issue or face the consequences.**",18,PDX

I was the third in line and there was only one agent working at the moment. Then a lady came over and seemed upset that no one was using the kiosks, she asked the gentleman in front of me to use it and he replied he’d rather wait which upset her even more. She then came to me and commanded (that’s right, commanded with a harsh and condescending tone) me to use, I told her it usually won’t work cuz I was flying to Taiwan with a Chinese passport, usually the kiosk would just ask me to see an agent for further visa document check. She refused to listen and kept telling me to pull out my passport and scan. I really didn’t want to argue so just scanned my passport to just prove it to her. After a few info verification then with no surprise a long document jumped up on the screen basically stating that traveller with Chinese passport would need a visa to visit Taiwan yada yada. Then I was like see that’s what I was talking about, but she wouldn’t give up and started asking me to show her my Taiwan visa. I gave her a document bag, she yanked it open and drop my stuff all over the floor!! Without a single apology she just stood there and started reading my visa. I looked at her and couldn’t believe it. She then look back at me and asked: “are you going to pick them up or what? They aren’t my stuff.” At that point I was really pissed and said:”Didn’t YOU drop them? What’s up with your attitude?!” She then threw the document back at me and said:” whatever, be my guess” and stormed away. 

This is my first time flying United after COVID and I could NOT believe what I just experienced. I don’t like playing victim but her attitude got even worse after seeing my passport which led me to believe there was also some racism against me. I asked her for her name and badge number and told her I was going to file a complaint. She refused to give me anything but her name. So I called United but according to their policy they only accept complaints after the trip is completed. Which means I can’t do anything until I return from Taiwan.

1gejspe,2024 Portland Voter's Guide? / My impromptu MAYOR comparison,2,1730167478.0,"Previous elections I saw guides on Reddit, detailing each candidate, and coupling with ""Reddit Peer Review,"" gave me confidence to vote a little more efficiently. I'm just now opening up my ballet and trying to figure shit out. Yes I am using google, can't find.

Please share link with me if you have anything. This is taking too many hours, with so little ""umph,"" I mean, all I got on these candidates is a pamphlet, google.. well how about a list that SOMEONE'S, SOMEWHERE. HAD TO HAVE ALREADY DONE, that graphs these candidates + and -'s in a easily read and digested format?

\-----

As a side discussion (be the change you want to see, if you don't see it, start it), here's my takes on Portland MAYOR Candidates:

(feel free to tell me your opinions, and I need to do my other parts of my ballot too..)

* Keith Wilson (1st choice so far): Sounds really popular and wants to address the homelessness issue head on, without jailing them? Does anyone know this person's stance on drug legalization? I admire this guy's attitude but without seeing a list of policy decisions/stances (and only looking at a face/pamphlet description) I worry they might be a little ""boomer"" on socialist policies.
* Rene Gonzales (No) : No, because he wants to re-criminalize drugs. As much as seeing poor people from my backyard worries me, people shouldn't be incarcerated for simply using recreational drugs. The problem with the way Portland decimalized drugs was they didn't follow through with treatment plans, AFAIK, and at about the same time Police suddenly stopped enforcing the law. One redditor I argued with says PPB is understaffed... didn't seem that way during the BLM protests. lol
* Michael O'Callaghan (2nd choice so far): Wants to impose vacant housing fines. Occupation: ""Skilled Master"" (that's what pamphlet says). Wants to created PORTLAND PEOPLE POLLING, which sounds like Portland Reddit. I... like it?
* Martin Ward: Unemployed professional ""Campaigner, Researcher, ""Doing God's Will."" Seriously fuck this guy. ""Homeless relief, LOWER RENT, police/education reform, NEW PARKS, FREE COLLEGE, LOWER TAXES"" these all sound great, unless you have a brain that works, and a nose that can differentiate bullshit from apple pie. Sorry Ward, please stay out of politics. Learn from people that know what they're doing before trying to be the forefront libertarian.
* Liv (Viva) Osthus: ""Artist"" sounds like she wants to protect the environment, water the trees, emphasis on safety. My skepticism tells me she is not cut out for the job, and that she would actually have no idea what she would be doing. Like O'Callaghan, no government experience. Liv sounds like a passionate individual, with a lot of insight on what effects HER and OTHERS she's connected with. I would love to see her giving input and ideas somewhere, but I worry she wouldn't be capable of balancing a budget, or solving complicated problems, with math.
* Alexander Laundry Neely: Winemaker. Passionate about ending homelessness ""FULL STOP"" but again, doesn't impress me as someone who understands how government work. It's honestly a tie between Liv and this guy (for 3rd or 4th or whatever'th rank, not 1st LOL!)
* Sharon Nasset: Hire more cops (meh), incarcerate repeat offenders (thought we did that already?), encourage electric vehicles with ""raffles"" (wtf doesn't sound serious), opposes Toll roads (ok ig... libertarian?) I'm gonna say no. Feel free to change my mind.
* Mingus Maps: Is an **African American Democrat** and a **father"",** and those are the things they decided to bold in his description. Clean up litter and graffiti: I like the graffiti (some), I don't like the litter. ""End street camping,"" I get the feeling this person is trying to appeal to everyone, while secretly being pretty far right. They list some actual governmental ""accomplishments,"" but idk. It even looks good, from the reading, just can't get that ""bullshit"" smell, even if it's my imagination.
* Josh Leake (better than Gonzales): This man has emotional ""umph"" allover his pamphlet bio, with lots of words like ""Focus on"" and 'make better,' language. I don't want to completely count him out, because he has government and *volunteer* experience, as well as financial executive experience. My problem here is Josh has the most boring and vague PR. God damn it Josh, I just want to know one thing: Are you left or right? Are you a trumper? Are you a libertarian? Are you a socialist? Tell us who the fuck you actually are. You might be strawberry, well a lot of people really prefer chocolate. OH WELL! Be honest, regardless.
* Michael Hayes (Tied for 2nd): Looks like good amount of experience and accomplishments. Claims credit for delivering Tiered-voting, which would be pretty cool if true. I might tie Michael Hayes at 2nd choice, having now read.
* Carmen Rubio: Something about ""No drama"" and unpaid parking tickets idfk. List of ""accomplishments"" as a (checks notes) ""Senior Policy Advisor, Commissionaire Nick Fish, Director of Community Affairs, Portland MAYOR and Police Chief Tom Potter."" What the fuck am I reading? That read like she WAS mayor, I'm confused.. was she mayor? Sorry, I'm a dumbass. Some kind Redditor help pls.",6,PDX

***This is for cheese pizza only***


1. Scottie’s: great sauce and decent cheese but the crust is awful. It legitimately tastes like a tortilla.  5.9

2. Pizza thief: embarrassing pizza. Sour crust, no sauce, and terrible cheese. 4.2

3. Dimo’s: cooked well but the ingredients are meh and it’s a meh pizza. 5.5

4. Baby Doll: of the recommendations Baby Doll is by far the best but it’s not amazing. Solid 7 but it’s nothing special.

5. Straight from New York: crust is a bit boring and the pizza is under cooked. If it was cooked properly I’d rate it around 7 but 6.2 for execution. 

Here for another week, please give me some recommendations that will restore my faith in PDX pizza.

Preferences: prefer pizza on the thinner side but not cracker thin. Love a good sauce and crust.

Borges doesn't have anywhere to pull off unless it's in someone's driveway, so I go 2 miles down to a store with small parking lot on foster road. I probably could have found a spot on foster road but I didn't want to be blocking the road at all or be in a driveway. It's like a 5 minute drive from where I found the dog to the store. I call the guy and tell him I'm pretty sure I've got his husky. He's says oh shit he must have slipped off his line. I tell him where I'm at and explain why I didn't stop sooner and I say I'll drive him back up to your house if you want, not a big deal. He gets mad at me for driving ""so far from his house"" and says he's going g to meet me at the store anyways. He pulls in screeches to a stop jumps out and throws open his door for his dog. The dog didn't want to get in so he kinda just threw it in the back. Didn't even say thank you or anything. Then says next time just leave his dog or take it to the pound. How was I supposed to know exactly where the dog came from? Was I wrong to drive 2 miles with the dog and then call him? Even after offering to drive back?

Has anyone been able to get through?,3,1678747140.0,"Tried using this service for the second time ever (the first time about a year and a half ago resulted in them sending police despite my telling them that the person in crisis was not being violent at all). First of all the number that I used last time went to 311 and they basically hung up on me after saying they didn’t do street response. Basically was trying to get help for a woman who was having a mental health crisis on the street. Waited on hold for 20 minutes before finally giving up. I noticed that when you first call the number it has a very long introduction, followed by the exact same excessively lengthy introduction entirely in Spanish (instead of the usual, “por Español prima a número dos” phrase). Perhaps I’m just paranoid, but it just seems like it took more and more roadblocks to actually connecting people with the seemingly ghost of a street response team, by putting in more and more roadblocks. I have read about the idea that the 911 dispatchers being in the police unions, not wanting to dispatch them for fear that it could threaten their jobs, just wondering if anyone has actually one, been able to reach the street response unit and have them come out and two, what was your experience?",2,PDX

On Saturday the family grabbed a tree and headed to Fernill park for a quick moment with the dog.  Standing at the SE corner we heard a cacophony of car horns coming North on 42nd - they turned and headed towards the park.  What is this? A low-rent funeral procession? A team celebration for winning something?  Some weird new car-horn kink? It certainly is an auditory assault on a nice day at the park!

The second car in the procession had an open hatch and a speaker facing out the back. Because the speaker is, you know, facing BACKWARDS it is only as the car gets 150'+ past us that we can make out what the person is telling us ... something about keeping the streets safe, that we aren't waving, that we're a bunch of racists for not waving.  WTF? I'm a racist for watching your little parade and trying to figure out why you are there?  Turns out the LAST car is flying two flags, one of which is BLM.  OH...

Your execution is incredibly poor! Please, flags at the front - and preferably a banner that faces forward - maybe even signs on the side of your car (a kindergartner can help you with that) so onlookers KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Omnidirectional speakers ...or at least understand that people can't hear you until you're well down the road.  And don't call people racist just because they can't make sense of your little parade - instead of building support you just fed the narrative that calls of racism are baseless.",16,PDX

2. Are you a doctor in a KP org? Don’t request traveling nurses. Speak up to admin in support of your striking nurses.  

3. Get vaccinated. If it’s been six months since your last dose, get a booster.

The current projects I have in mind are:  

* A stolen vehicle spreadsheet that folks can reference, compiled from reddit posts (and possibly nextdoor, craigslist, etc)  

* An interactive chart of Portland's agencies and bureaus and the services they provide  

* A list of Apps that you can download and use to stay up to date about various conditions (crime, weather, health concerns, etc) in the Portland area  

* Free or very affordable skill building classes that teach life saving techniques, like CPR/First Aid, mental health awareness, strategies for crisis intervention and suicide prevention, natural disaster response, etc...  

* Objective data mapping for things like crime statistics and city responses to promote informed discourse

My idea is to record a brief 1-3 minute trailer, once that is done, I will post it on GoFundMe and try to make a professional movie that will be entered in Film Festivals.

*All Actors need to have the ability to cry on command.

Actors Needed

Nessa (23) - Scrawny African American woman who is wise beyond her years, but still has a lot to learn. 

Maggy (6) - Small white girl. Extremely optimistic and hopeful, but is starting to show signs of bi-polar disorder.

Lenny (30-40's) - (Any Ethnicity) Caring child protective service officer. 

Pea (30-40's) - (Any Ethnicity) Child Psychologist and wife of Lenny. Pea is very observant and intelligent, but doesn't come off as overly smart.

Marge (30's) - White woman. Marge is the adult version of Maggy. Marge is a very loving woman, when it comes to her kids. She is very stressed and tired all the time. 

Grant (30's) - (Any Ethnicity) Marges Husband who is basically her 3rd child. He has depth and emotion, but he hides it a lot.

Of course, these are very broad versions of the character. If you would like to know more, or if you're interested in the project and getting your name and acting credits out there email me: justinmichaels97@gmail.com

If you are looking to be one of the actors, sending any good picture of yourself or a video of you doing a monologue just to gauge your ability. Thanks and have a great day.",15,PDX
o939mp,"PSA: Do not use dry ice to cool your home. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide, and can genuinely kill you.",47,1624820323.0,"A couple pounds of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) is enough to give you CO2 poisoning in a reasonably sized room once sublimated. 

I know it's very hot outside, and dry ice plus a fan might seem like a good solution. You CAN use it, but if you do, please put it inside of a tightly sealed flexible airtight container like a heavy vacuum sealed bag, and blow the fan over that instead. The bag will contain the sublimated CO2, and - you know - not kill you.

I recommend a small chunk of dry ice per large sealed container, so the container doesn't burst as the CO2 sublimates.

Be safe today, friends.

EDIT: Also, please be aware that opening your fridge or freezer will not cool down your home.

I am nervous about this likely eventuality and am willing to wait longer to work with the right doctors. I have a very good health insurance plan through my employer with a low deductible and relatively low out of pocket max. So now is the time for me to get this work done (if that indeed is the decision).

Thank you in advance for any guidance or suggestions!

Hi Y’all! 

So I grew up in Portland’s suburbs but have basically never really lived here as an adult and am currently trying to make friends and stave off boredom. I’m a long time quizzer and looking for difficult pub quizzes, preferably ones that are relatively analog (quizmaster reads questions, you write down the answers on paper) and general knowledge rather than being too pop culture minded. And of course, good vibes. Perhaps a young-ish crowd too, if that exists 

If anyone knows of any good ones, please suggest them. Alternatively, if anyone knows of a bar looking for a quizmaster, I might be interested!

1nvoast,Vet clinic that's good with cats?,5,1759362023.0,"I'm in NW and don't have a car so I kinda just defaulted to Northwest Neighborhood Veterinary Hospital and I am SO unhappy with them. I was there with one of my kittens a couple weeks ago and the vet came in 30 minutes late and then literally told me to wrap it up after only being in the room for 10 minutes. Didn't answer a single question I came in with.

Now my other kitten is having significant issues with her appetite and they're just not concerned. Getting them to treat a situation with any urgency has been impossible and I'm just over it.

Anyway, I'm looking for a new vet clinic where the vets are knowledgeable about cats. They would ideally be in/near NW or at least easy to get to via a single bus (I'm right by the 15, 24, and 77 lines). I'd like a clinic that can accommodate same day urgent appointments, since it's one of the few reasons I've stuck with my current vet.

Lastly, I'd just like my pets and I to be treated with empathy and compassion. I know a lot of people in vet med are burned out and I truly empathize, but I'm just a human who worries about my babies when they're sick.

1nurrz4,Rental broker? No rental broker?,0,1759272570.0,"Hi y'all. Sorry if this isn't the right channel, but I've been searching for other Redditors' thoughts on this topic and haven't had much luck, so I'm asking. 

My roomie/best friend and I are planning our move to Portland next summer. That seems like a ways out, but we're moving across the country and have some other logistical things to work out, so I've been trying to get organized/get our budgets aligned. 

If we were able to rent an apartment, I wouldn't be stressed about housing at all. But we have two noisy little old rescue dogs, and I really don't want to be constantly anxious and shushing them with too many shared walls. So we're looking for a single-family home, MAYBE a townhome or a duplex, depending on the layout/build/if we could sequester them away from a shared wall when we're gone. 

Realistically, we have a pretty long runway. We don't have to be out of our house until August and are planning to start looking in April or May, since we could swing two rents if it were only for a couple of months. But I just learned about the first-come, first-served law and have been monitoring the rental sites to see how quickly things get snapped up. 

With all that context, Has anyone used a rental broker for a long-distance move? I understand that we're likely still going to need to apply ourselves, but I'm trying to think of any way to make the house-hunting process simpler. My thought is that one might be helpful if we were trying to plan a week or two in Portland for house hunting, possibly serving as an aggregator of open houses we should be touring and submitting to. Maybe that's wishful thinking. 

I know somebody is going to tell us to just do a short-term rental. If we absolutely have to, we will, but I have pretty severe allergies and work from home, so being able to control the furniture/textiles in my environment is really important. 

Thanks y'all. I adore Portland, just wish I wasn't so pre-stressed about the process of getting there. ",12,askportland

Having lived on the East Coast for many years, I feel like my insulated parka with a furry hood--while quite warm--isn't ideal for the cold, wet weather we have here (I don't think it's fully waterproof, for example). I'm eyeing those 3-in-1 jackets Columbia has, since they are versatile, waterproof (well done, I think) and comfortable. And something in ""medium"" warmth, since it is rarely bitterly cold in Portland (but often quite chilly in the winter). 

Any recommendations? The Hikebound II, Bugaboo III, and Abiqua Falls by Columbia all look fairly similar and would be good options I think. I'm not a skier, so I really am looking for something to wear outside around town, not for camping or serious snow activities.

I know equipment is expensive, as is down payment, but if anywhere could do something like this if feels like Portland is somewhere that's tried.

I want to mimic the financial situation she's likely to experience as much as I can so she's not just thrown into the deep end with no practice. My plan is to charge her ""rent"" until she moves, which will mimic the cost of living in Portland (including housing, utilities, food, transport, healthcare, etc), then I'll hold on to her ""rent"" as her savings for when she moves. I'm afraid I'm too old to really understand what she'll be facing as a young person entering adulthood in this day and age, so if anyone wouldn't mind sharing with me a breakdown of their actual budget and monthly expenditures, it would really help!

I just rescued a dog yesterday and it happened very quickly. I’ve been looking for a while but wasn’t expecting it to happen that day. Anyways, he is a super sweet, 3 year old mini poodle mix. I’ve never rescued before, I’ve only had experience with my parents’ dogs from breeders so this is very new to me. I want to train him using positive reinforcement for sure. I do think he was abused—he’s very skiddish and if he comes up to me, I gently and slowly put my hand out for him to sniff and he winces like I’m going to hit him. It makes me so sad. I only engage if he shows me he wants me to.

I’m showing him love on his terms, patience and giving him treats to encourage him (which he unfortunately rarely takes at the moment). I know it will take time for him to decompress, feel comfortable, and feel at home, but since I’ve never rescued a dog before, I want to make sure I’m doing all the right things and not traumatizing him in any way. He’s had quite a few accidents in the house despite walks. I live in an apartment complex with a small patio. I did get a grass pad for him but he still hasn’t figured out it’s for going potty and not laying down lol. I do have a crate set up for him and keep the door open if he wants to go in it and he has a few times.

I do work full time and am planning on getting a dog walker for him initially and then once he feels more comfortable, I would like to bring him to a doggie daycare. Does anyone have any recommendations for the following:
1. Training including crate training and potty training
2. Dog walker
3. Doggie daycare

I live in the Buckman area/central southeast Portland. Any other recommendations or tips for anything else are also welcome. Thanks so much!

I'm coming from Medford, OR, and I've been daydreaming about walking in walkable neighborhoods/downtown areas, getting coffee etc... but I'm apartment searching on a budget. So I'm looking mostly at 1 bedrooms under $1300/mo.

Anyways, I've found a few options with some options in the NW/Alphabet district, a few just outside downtown lines next to PSU, and some that are in the Multnomah Village area. 

The best bang for my buck option I found is a 1bd 1bath apt 580sq/ft with 1 parking spot included for $1100/mo in the Multnomah Village area (10-15mins from downtown). After that there's apt options next to PSU just outside downtown lines for around $1200/mo with 500sq/ft and street permit parking. Last is NW/Alphabet district apartment options at $1300/mo to live in a smaller 400-500sq/ft apartment, but walkability is amazing. Street parking is more risky for break-ins here, though.

Anyways, is the walkable neighborhood in NW worth the extra $200/mo in costs? Or would it not feel like I miss anything from living a 10-minute drive away from downtown?

I 100% want my car, so I have to take into account parking costs. Would a middle-ground location, like being close to PSU, but not directly in a walkable neighborhood, be a good option? I also work 100% remote, which is why the size of the apt is a concern for me.

I get that I can only know what I really want for myself, but I want your opinions on how you feel about that trade-off personally.

I then got a job on the East Coast and I've been there ever since. Even though I have a great life and career in DC, I've recently had an overwhelming urge to go back home. It's hard to explain, but every time I visit and then leave, I feel incredibly sad. I actually once cried when my plane took off. I mentioned something offhand to my partner about it and he surprisingly said he's always loved the PNW and we should do it. That sparked a year-long conversation about logistics and timing, and whether we should actually uproot our lives here for a fresh start. We both own property and my career is location-specific so I'd lose a lot of what I've built by starting over in a new place. But life is about so much more than money and a job. It will be a lot of moving parts (selling our homes, job search, move across country, etc.) but it's completely possible. We're now thinking next fall.

1nsjp0z,Haunted experiences at McMenamins Bagdad Theater?,69,1759050462.0,"edit:

should say this is the first time I'd been to this theater!  i'd never been to any McMenamins property, and I didn't know anything about their history/marketing/mythology prior.

this is also the first time in my life i've ever had an experience with something that appeared to be a ghost.

\*\*

Just got home from the late showing of *One Battle After Another* (it's good - I recommend).  The showing started at 10:45 and this film has an almost 3 hour running time, so it was over around 2 a.m.  I went by myself and sat in the middle of the theater on the floor level.  I usually watch a film until the credits are totally over, so am typically the last person there.

But this time, as the credits rolled, I could hear floor sweeping that sounded like it was right behind me.

I kept watching the credits for a bit, but figured the person working there was trying to give me a hint, so I stood up to leave before the credits were done....

...and there was no one there.  No usher, nobody with a broom.  The sound of sweeping had also stopped.  My first thought was to ask an employee if the place was haunted, but I didn't see a single soul in the theater, nor in the lobby, as I walked out.

I guess it's possible that the acoustics could've just been crazy and maybe the usher was sweeping up in the balcony and it somehow sounded like it was a row or two directly behind me....but how?

\*\*

Googled it right away and the internet says the theater is widely considered to be haunted, and the most prominent spirit is a former maintenance person.

It didn't feel threatening or anything - I actually tried to talk to it a little as I stood there.  It seems spookier now that I'm home.

So I was wondering...anyone else have stories about running into McMenamins Bagdad ghosts?",25,askportland

1nrijqc,Any advice on PGE overcharge?,6,1758936105.0,"I just got my electric bill for the month - it's 10x higher than my previous highest bill ever. Their website shows normal daily usage, but over 17000 kwh (17mwh) for the month. I didn't even use that much over the previous 12 months combined!

Any advice on dealing with PGE? I called and they told me to set up a payment plan.

Edit: This is not related to my solar installation. I can confirm without any doubt whatsoever there was NO solar generation before the meter swap on the 22nd, and that meter swap is why the billing cycle ended on the 21st.
The Enphase gateway was installed prior to the billing cycle, and the Enphase app clearly shows there was no power generated or exported during that month. It also clearly shows only 1.3mwh consumed for the month. And even if it was due to power being exported? They are charging me for more than a year of power in one month. My solar system is designed for LESS than that over an entire year. It's not going to do it a month.

This is not an issue with my electrical, not an issue with my solar, and if it was an issue with the meter it's too late to confirm because that meter is gone.

The question is solely about advice on dealing with PGE, because it's not caused by my actual power consumption.",21,askportland

I took classes when I was a kid and have dipped back in a few times over the years (I'm in my early 30s now). I've seen that most Portland area schools have adult classes. What's the inside scoop on their overall quality, vibe, friendliness level for adult students? Do they have a particular emphasis like competition, community, or local performance?

My additional very specific question is whether there's a school that would be more likely to have other queer folks. I'm used to and kind of expect to be the only trans person, especially at more suburban schools, but it would be very cool to meet other queer Irish dancers.

Person applied for the HRSN grant in November 2024 and again in December 2024. 

Received a formal eviction notice January 7 2025. Was accepted for the grant on January 14 2025

Letter was sent stating I was accepted for 6 months of paid rent and 6 months of utilities. 

Lawyers officer and property management did not return phone calls or connect in any way by cure by date, in fact could not get ahold of them at all until court April 16. 

Told the judge and court that HRSN was promised, here is the letter from Care Oregon. 

They still did not pay. Persons heavily advocated through every avenue to get help, there was no help. 

Reached out to multiple organizations to help with rent, but they said they couldn’t help until the grant paid because the amount that is needed is too much to help with. 

Trial date was set for June 2nd 2025. Person could not afford an attorney. Person now owes 39,000$ in back rent to property management HRSN still didn’t pay, nor could there be help with.

Person was evicted from their home of 5 years on July 1st, and now owes more money than they make in a year. 

Person now has ruined credit, an eviction on their record, a repossessed car, and their name has been absolutely tarnished as well for something that they relied on the state to do. 

They have reached out to basically every free resource like:

OHA
Care Oregon
HRSN hold line for hours at a time, only to be hung up on.
Oregon state bar 
community alliance of tenants 
Oregon law center 
211
Clear clinic
Metropolitan Public Defenders 

But a lot of them have conflict of interest because it’s a program through OHP care Oregons they’ve been told. 

Any help yall have would be great, I’m just the messenger but I genuinely feel for this person and am wanting to help them the best I can.

My wife and I are planning on visiting Portland between Christmas and New Years to do a little neighborhood scouting, as we are hoping to move to your city next year. We stayed in Portland for a few days way back in 2015, and fell in love with the city. We’ve talked about moving there ever since, and are now in a position where we can pull the trigger.

Ideally we’d like to stay in a somewhat central neighborhood with good MAX access - I had thought Kerns but maybe closer to Downtown/the Pearl? We won’t have a car and want to get around as much as possible using public transit. 

The plan is basically to spend a day in each quadrant (sextant?), eating, drinking, and doing as the locals do, but also to envision what it would really be like to live there full time. I’m compiling a list of places we’ll try to hit in each area, and attempt to cram in as much as we can over the 4 or 5 days we’ll be there. I know there’s no shortage of world-class restaurants and cool, unique shops, so the focus will be more on getting a vibe check for the neighborhoods, what commuting would look like, etc. 

How dead should we expect the city to be? I know things tend to slow down in that period between Christmas and New Years generally, but I don’t know how much that applies in Portland specifically. Do a lot of smaller businesses close up shop? Does the city “empty out” noticeably as people go to visit family or stay in for a few days? As an example, we love pub trivia and would ideally be able to stop in somewhere to play one of the nights we’re in town — should we expect a lot of them to be off that week?

I'm 33, laid off software engineer and took a break from job-hunting for the summer to help my ND kiddo improves some skills before the school year started. I've come to have quite a routine of dropping my kids off at school, then spending 3-4 hours at a coffee shop job prepping, then going to movement for a climb/lift workout and then usually going home to eat and walk the dog, then picking up the kiddos from school and doing the parenting thang till I drop.

Any recommendations for other cool spots to check out that aren’t too far? Tomorrow we’re going to Mt Ranier so today we wanted to check out nature spots closer to Vancouver. 

Also I’m very big into foraging! I know it hasn’t been super rainy so I likely won’t find tooo many mushrooms while out and about but are there any other things that are in season to forage for currently? I was able to find some blackberries around Vancouver lake yesterday! They did seem to be at the very end of their season but I was still able to find quite a few. Ideally I’m looking for things like fruits and berries, mushrooms and plants, or things like shellfish that could be foraged near rivers.

Foraging is just a bonus though! Any cool nature spots around Multnomah would be super appreciated!",3,askportland

We’re looking at the Signature Hybrid from RVMattress since it has an Olympic queen size and the height is double our current setup. We’re being careful with deciding since it’s going to be our everyday bed so it has to be comfortable for the both of us.

I organize a meetup for former educators and teachers transitioning (or considering transitioning) into a new industry/career. This is something I do off the clock every 2 months or so - as a former teacher myself - to build community and help connect folks to each other, to resources, and share stories and opportunities. It’s a tough job market out there and for those who may have only worked in education or been in the industry for a long time, it can be a really difficult shift. 

I’m looking for a space on the east side and centrally-located where we can hold our October meetup. Somewhere where folks can gather open house style from 6-8pm on a Wednesday evening to connect over food/drink. 

This has proven tough because I have no budget as a solo organizer. Specifically, I need to find a place that: 
- allows me to reserve table space for about 15 people without a fee
- doesn’t have a food & beverage minimum
- allows people to just have their own tab
- is indoors, unless there’s a covered and heated patio.

Solo traveler, 32F. I’m an architectural historian and I love vintage, eclectic, spooky, and historic things. I’m also a big wine enthusiast and hoping to explore Oregon wines too!

I won’t have a car and I’m an avid walker so I’m also wondering if these are walking distance or near public transport to get to any cool neighborhoods, restaurants, bars, coffee shops.

I’m also open to other hotel recommendations!

Also would love your recommendations for Oregon wines, wineries/wine bars, or anyrhing associated with wine!

I’m also going to research any historic architecture tours in the city which I haven’t had the chance to look into yet.

Original post- Concerts are stressful. I’ve been to my fair share in my teenage years (warped tour, crowded messes at the Hawthorne and Wonder Ballroom), and decided that concerts just weren’t something I wanted to do anymore.

Something came over me, however, and I convinced myself to go to a concert at the moda center next month. I’ve never attended a show at a venue this large and I have NO idea what to expect. For those of you who are seasoned pros, I’d love to hear from you! 

How early do you get there? How bad is the parking? Is it better to park elsewhere and get an uber to take you there? 

If the lines are long, is most of the waiting done outside? Just trying to plan in case the weather is bad. 

We know our section and row, but not the seat number. Is that assigned closer to the event date or do all the people assigned to that row just fight over who sits where? 

Do you pass through metal sensors? I have a lot of orthopedic hardware and I don’t want to set off the detectors and jeopardize my ability to attend.

1nbh2q1,Lost Stuffed Bear Please Help,16,1757315655.0,"Hello,

I have just returned from a vacation around the Pacific Northwest. This past Thursday, 9/4, my girlfriend and I stayed at the Kimpton Vintage Portland room 606. We were in a rush in the morning and unfortunately lost her stuffed bear, a substantially sentimental item from her grandmother. She has been beside herself with panic attacks and frankly, the hotel has not been the most responsive, consistently only looking at a webpage to see if the bear has been “logged.” 

We are certain the bear is either behind/under the bed or in the laundry. We are offering a $750 reward (in addition to expedited shipping) for the return of the bear. Please… help us.

1n7n4rs,Apartment building and neighborhood recommendations,0,1756924829.0,"I'm considering a move to Portland and was hoping people could chime in on some recommendations for apartment buildings, property management companies, and neighborhoods. I am planning to visit the area to check things out, but I'd like to have a starting point for where to scout out when I head up there. I've included a little about me and listed what I'm looking for below, so if places you are recommending meet these, or are missing some, please feel free to share what might be included/excluded. Thanks in advance for all the help!

About me
Mid 30's guy. LGBT identifying. Like to participate in various adult recreational sports/leagues and social events. Looking for somewhere that is walkable and social but doesn't necessarily need to be right in the middle of everything. An area where people are friendly or if there is a good meeting spot to socialize would be nice since I won't know many people if I make the move.

Budget
- Ideally I would like to be at $1500 or less. Not necessarily the lower the better, but trying to be reasonable while meeting my higher priority items below.

Amenities
Higher priority amenities I would like on my wish list
- 1 bedroom (large studio could possibly work depending on layout and square footage)
- 575+ sq feet (I work remote so need some room for my desk and normal living)
- W/D in unit (if not in unit then onsite at minimum)
- Parking spot available/included (covered preferably)
- A/C
- Onsite fitness center/gym (not a requirement but would love it)
- A building that doesn't need a lot of repairs (ex: not turning off water every other week for repairs)

Medium priority amenities that would be nice to have
- Bike parking or storage
- Dishwasher
- Secure/gated entry
- Something with a view that's not just facing another building or wall would be nice
- Community/apartment events/socials to meet people/neighbors
- Swimming Pool and/or hot tub

Location
- Walkable neighborhood to park(s), grocery store, coffee shop, and a few social bars to meet people.
- Safe area

Please feel free to share any and all recommendations, links to apartment complex websites or property management websites you recommend, etc. I would plan on visiting in the next two months or so and moving early next year. Thanks again everyone!",11,PDX

1mzv9lo,Huge thank you to area soccer refs!,5,1756139358.0,"While temperatures this weekend soared to 100º, the annual Summer Slam tournament took place across Portland, Vancouver and Camas. Many of these matches occur on turf where temps can be as much as 40º higher than the air temperature. While players can sub out and get in front of a fan, get more water, get a cold wash cloth, etc... The refs are out there on the pitch at a constant for the entire match, and matches are back-to-back-to-back-to-back. We saw multiple refs experiencing heat exhaustion causing other refs to have to race across town and officiate ""one more match"". We even had a situation where a match had to start late and our ref officiated the whole match well after sundown on an unlit field. The kids could see, but the old parent eyes could only see a white ball and boots.

Somehow, in all of this, we still have parents on the side lines that feel fit to audibly criticize these referees despite the fact that the game simply cannot happen without them.

So here's to you refs. I know it's not the pay that brings you out.  Your love for the game enables you to put up with the heat and the bullshit so that these kids can love this game the way you do. We appreciate you.",0,PDX

I am posting this to request any cell phone video of a security incident that occurred at C C slaughters on July 19 around 9:30 PM. This request is of my own accord and is not requested by any of the parties involved.

Two friends of mine went to cc slaughters on July 19. When one of them (a person of color) went to order a drink, the bartender made it incorrectly. When she politely corrected him, he flipped out and told her that he was going to call security and call the cops on her. She backed away from him slowly and joined my other friend, her girlfriend. Before they knew it two security guards , scooped my friend up from behind each arm, and told her that she needed to leave. While dragging her out of the bar. Once outside, they pinned her to the ground. Her girlfriend, was understandably very distraught. She, as well as a good Samaritan, who saw the entire incident, tried to stop security from continuing to assault her. When the police came, they arrested, my friend who was pinned by security, my other friend (her girlfriend), as well as the good Samaritan. 

The cops claim they saw bar’s security footage of my friend, punching the security guards, but that simply isn’t true. Multiple witnesses saw that she was being dragged or pinned the entire time completely helpless. I looked at her hands myself, and there are no injuries to indicate that she punched somebody multiple times. She does however have multiple injuries to her head and neck from being assaulted by the security guards. 

My friends are getting an attorney, but we are fearful that the security footage will “disappear” when the bar closes down. Please if you were there that night. And you witnessed this incident and even better if you took cell phone video DM me.

I'm in the early stages of a documentary project about Portland's cable access television scene during the 1980s and 90s and ***I need your help***!

**Some context about the project:**

* I'm exploring how cable access TV during this time period reflected Portland's unique culture and provided space for creative expression.
* I'm currently looking at shows like Jim Spagg, The Chess Show, Insanity, Where's the Art, but interested in ALL cable access programming from this period.
* Currently investigating themes of free expression, censorship challenges, how marginalized communities used this platform, and the preservation efforts happening today
* I'm interested in documenting the history and legacy of community media in PDX

**I'm hoping to connect with:**

* People who created or worked on cable access shows
* Viewers who regularly watched or called in
* Staff who worked at the stations/facilities
* Anyone with archives, recordings, or memorabilia
* Those who remember how cable access impacted Portland's communities

**If you or someone you know was part of this scene, I'd love to hear:**

* What shows do you remember watching or creating?
* Any memorable moments, episodes, or personalities?
* How did cable access reflect Portland's culture at that time?
* Do you have any recordings, photos, or materials from that era?
* How did your experience with cable access impact you?

This is a passion project aimed at preserving this unique piece of Portland's media history before memories and materials are lost to time. I'm particularly interested in how cable access television provided a platform for voices and perspectives that weren't represented in mainstream media.

Feel free to comment below or DM me if you'd prefer to share privately. I'm happy to chat over coffee with anyone who has stories to share!

I lived in Gresham and then closer to downtown for my stint there, so anywhere between those two spots is okay. Just looking for somewhere on the safer side. I’ll be renting a car, so neighborhoods with some okay parking is appreciated.

Police and schools are AWARE…

Today my 15 year-old nephew with Autism Spectrum Disorder was attacked by 7 students. At least 1 from Roosevelt and the others from George. They broke his phone and stole his cash. 

He had been hit repeatedly in the head by one student and has huge red marks on his inner arm and is sore on other various parts of his body.
He’s processing the incident and I’ll provide any more info when I can.

Please if anyone has any footage of 2 females and  5 males of different races walking NORTH toward Fessenden.

1jigcph,Are there any companies that accept teens with only a highschool graduate and only 5 previous jobs?,9,1742782657.0,"Hi! I'm so sorry if this isn't a good place to ask, or is a stretch to ask for, but I'm at a loss right now. 

I just graduated highschool last summer and had been trying to find work, I had a job but it was only seasonal and I was let go after 3 months. I've been trying to find a new one and have applied quite literally every business with a career page, or application options, that I could find. Not a single store will except me because I don't have enough customer service experience, and food places won't take me either because I'm over qualified (I still got no clue what that means honestly.) 
No matter where I apply to, I hear nothing back from the application. I'm a little fearful to keep finding fast food places to apply to in Portland because my disability affects my ability to walk really long distances, and I live in Hillsboro, I don't know if any fast food places far from me would be willing to accept me long term because of me having medical episodes. 

My last job was a warehouse one, I tried looking for other jobs like it close to me since I walk, take the max, and bus places, however I only find places asking for a degree in something for lots of experience. 

I've worked at a radio station and a clinic as an intern, and was a full time nanny between ages 13 - 15 in foster care where I had to administer medication and watch over the kids while the parents left often. The same time I also baby sat occasionally so I'd have extra money. 

I haven't found a single place willing to take me that normal teens go for, so I was going to try finding either remote jobs, or companies that are also warehouse, or things that tie into experience I already have such as event planning when i was with the radio station. 
I was hoping, if my past jobs and disabilities disqualify me from most retail and customer service jobs, if I could find at least something in line of what I've done before so hopefully they'd take me. 

Does anyone know of any jobs that would accept a work history like this, or a woman with only a highschool diploma and disabilities? I will take any job that has a chance at accepting me, as long as it's within 1 1/2 - 2 hour commute since I'd be walking and taking the max most of the way. 

I'm really sorry if this question is really redundant as well, I'm just really struggling and unsure where to go if most teenage accepting jobs aren't accepting my applications, I don't know where to go. 

I also apologize for any spelling errors or if the way I word things was weird, or if i rambled a little too much, I haven't slept in days trying to find some sort of job and stressing over it. My father is also out of work and I was the one bringing in money at my last job, so I'm stressing trying to find something that pays at least a little over minimum wage so I can keep us afloat until he finds something. 

Thank you so much for reading.  

Edit: I don't know if this helps but these are all the places I've applied to-

I haven't really found any entry level positions that are accepting yet, and I'm not sure where else to look.

1idcbrj,"If Multnomah County Won't Act on Crime, Let’s Make Them!",0,1738205340.0,"I wanted to share something I’ve been thinking about regarding property crime in our community and what I believe the county should do to address it. Over the years, Multnomah County has drastically cut its jail capacity, leaving many empty jail beds and insufficient funding for our district attorney’s office to go after criminals meaningfully. This is having a direct impact on our neighborhood's safety. You see it posted here almost every day or week. Fr.

The sad truth is that while county officials seem to express concern about the crime happening, they haven't really prioritized addressing it in the ways we need, like focusing on appropriate policing, prosecution, and putting consequences in place for those committing property crimes. That’s why I’m proposing a new initiative called the Accountability for Property Crime Initiative. Working Title at the moment.

This initiative is designed to hold county leaders accountable by providing a 'Crime Victim Compensation Fund' to help property crime victims. The way things are now if your car gets broken into or your bike gets stolen, the inconvenience is bad enough. But if someone’s job depends on their car or their livelihood relies on their bike, that impact is devastating. The same goes for small business owners dealing with constant break-ins and vandalism. This proposal would help them directly by providing compensation for crime victims and helping those who are struggling with these issues.

Here’s what the proposal would do:

1. **County Charter Amendment**: This would ensure that the charter takes precedence over other ordinances and cannot be changed without a vote of the people.
2. **Victim Compensation**: The County would pay victims up to $2,500 per occurrence, and claims would need to be processed within 60 days, at least until crime levels return to pre-pandemic levels.
3. **Crime Victim's Office**: It would create a dedicated office to handle victim claims, similar to the one a commercial insurance company has.
4. **Incentivized County Action**: The county would be incentivized to pursue criminals to recover the payouts made to victims.
5. **No New Taxes**: The program would be funded by the County, but it **can’t raise taxes.** This would likely push the County to prioritize funds and make necessary budget cuts in less essential areas.

This initiative would create real change and force the County to act for the people most affected by crime. It could also encourage the County to reopen and expand jail space, leading to fewer repeat offenders committing crimes while waiting for trial.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this idea. It seems like we can solve our problem... Multnomah Counties problem and help figure out this mess.

**TL;DR: Multnomah County's inaction on property crime negatively impacts everyday people. A new proposal would establish a victims’ compensation fund, providing up to $2,500 for losses until crime rates improve. This initiative would compel the county to create more jail space and hold criminals accountable while avoiding tax increases. The aim: motivate county leaders to address the issue or face the consequences.**",18,PDX

I was the third in line and there was only one agent working at the moment. Then a lady came over and seemed upset that no one was using the kiosks, she asked the gentleman in front of me to use it and he replied he’d rather wait which upset her even more. She then came to me and commanded (that’s right, commanded with a harsh and condescending tone) me to use, I told her it usually won’t work cuz I was flying to Taiwan with a Chinese passport, usually the kiosk would just ask me to see an agent for further visa document check. She refused to listen and kept telling me to pull out my passport and scan. I really didn’t want to argue so just scanned my passport to just prove it to her. After a few info verification then with no surprise a long document jumped up on the screen basically stating that traveller with Chinese passport would need a visa to visit Taiwan yada yada. Then I was like see that’s what I was talking about, but she wouldn’t give up and started asking me to show her my Taiwan visa. I gave her a document bag, she yanked it open and drop my stuff all over the floor!! Without a single apology she just stood there and started reading my visa. I looked at her and couldn’t believe it. She then look back at me and asked: “are you going to pick them up or what? They aren’t my stuff.” At that point I was really pissed and said:”Didn’t YOU drop them? What’s up with your attitude?!” She then threw the document back at me and said:” whatever, be my guess” and stormed away. 

This is my first time flying United after COVID and I could NOT believe what I just experienced. I don’t like playing victim but her attitude got even worse after seeing my passport which led me to believe there was also some racism against me. I asked her for her name and badge number and told her I was going to file a complaint. She refused to give me anything but her name. So I called United but according to their policy they only accept complaints after the trip is completed. Which means I can’t do anything until I return from Taiwan.

1gejspe,2024 Portland Voter's Guide? / My impromptu MAYOR comparison,2,1730167478.0,"Previous elections I saw guides on Reddit, detailing each candidate, and coupling with ""Reddit Peer Review,"" gave me confidence to vote a little more efficiently. I'm just now opening up my ballet and trying to figure shit out. Yes I am using google, can't find.

Please share link with me if you have anything. This is taking too many hours, with so little ""umph,"" I mean, all I got on these candidates is a pamphlet, google.. well how about a list that SOMEONE'S, SOMEWHERE. HAD TO HAVE ALREADY DONE, that graphs these candidates + and -'s in a easily read and digested format?

\-----

As a side discussion (be the change you want to see, if you don't see it, start it), here's my takes on Portland MAYOR Candidates:

(feel free to tell me your opinions, and I need to do my other parts of my ballot too..)

* Keith Wilson (1st choice so far): Sounds really popular and wants to address the homelessness issue head on, without jailing them? Does anyone know this person's stance on drug legalization? I admire this guy's attitude but without seeing a list of policy decisions/stances (and only looking at a face/pamphlet description) I worry they might be a little ""boomer"" on socialist policies.
* Rene Gonzales (No) : No, because he wants to re-criminalize drugs. As much as seeing poor people from my backyard worries me, people shouldn't be incarcerated for simply using recreational drugs. The problem with the way Portland decimalized drugs was they didn't follow through with treatment plans, AFAIK, and at about the same time Police suddenly stopped enforcing the law. One redditor I argued with says PPB is understaffed... didn't seem that way during the BLM protests. lol
* Michael O'Callaghan (2nd choice so far): Wants to impose vacant housing fines. Occupation: ""Skilled Master"" (that's what pamphlet says). Wants to created PORTLAND PEOPLE POLLING, which sounds like Portland Reddit. I... like it?
* Martin Ward: Unemployed professional ""Campaigner, Researcher, ""Doing God's Will."" Seriously fuck this guy. ""Homeless relief, LOWER RENT, police/education reform, NEW PARKS, FREE COLLEGE, LOWER TAXES"" these all sound great, unless you have a brain that works, and a nose that can differentiate bullshit from apple pie. Sorry Ward, please stay out of politics. Learn from people that know what they're doing before trying to be the forefront libertarian.
* Liv (Viva) Osthus: ""Artist"" sounds like she wants to protect the environment, water the trees, emphasis on safety. My skepticism tells me she is not cut out for the job, and that she would actually have no idea what she would be doing. Like O'Callaghan, no government experience. Liv sounds like a passionate individual, with a lot of insight on what effects HER and OTHERS she's connected with. I would love to see her giving input and ideas somewhere, but I worry she wouldn't be capable of balancing a budget, or solving complicated problems, with math.
* Alexander Laundry Neely: Winemaker. Passionate about ending homelessness ""FULL STOP"" but again, doesn't impress me as someone who understands how government work. It's honestly a tie between Liv and this guy (for 3rd or 4th or whatever'th rank, not 1st LOL!)
* Sharon Nasset: Hire more cops (meh), incarcerate repeat offenders (thought we did that already?), encourage electric vehicles with ""raffles"" (wtf doesn't sound serious), opposes Toll roads (ok ig... libertarian?) I'm gonna say no. Feel free to change my mind.
* Mingus Maps: Is an **African American Democrat** and a **father"",** and those are the things they decided to bold in his description. Clean up litter and graffiti: I like the graffiti (some), I don't like the litter. ""End street camping,"" I get the feeling this person is trying to appeal to everyone, while secretly being pretty far right. They list some actual governmental ""accomplishments,"" but idk. It even looks good, from the reading, just can't get that ""bullshit"" smell, even if it's my imagination.
* Josh Leake (better than Gonzales): This man has emotional ""umph"" allover his pamphlet bio, with lots of words like ""Focus on"" and 'make better,' language. I don't want to completely count him out, because he has government and *volunteer* experience, as well as financial executive experience. My problem here is Josh has the most boring and vague PR. God damn it Josh, I just want to know one thing: Are you left or right? Are you a trumper? Are you a libertarian? Are you a socialist? Tell us who the fuck you actually are. You might be strawberry, well a lot of people really prefer chocolate. OH WELL! Be honest, regardless.
* Michael Hayes (Tied for 2nd): Looks like good amount of experience and accomplishments. Claims credit for delivering Tiered-voting, which would be pretty cool if true. I might tie Michael Hayes at 2nd choice, having now read.
* Carmen Rubio: Something about ""No drama"" and unpaid parking tickets idfk. List of ""accomplishments"" as a (checks notes) ""Senior Policy Advisor, Commissionaire Nick Fish, Director of Community Affairs, Portland MAYOR and Police Chief Tom Potter."" What the fuck am I reading? That read like she WAS mayor, I'm confused.. was she mayor? Sorry, I'm a dumbass. Some kind Redditor help pls.",6,PDX

Dear driver of the car with Washington plate CCS1111 

 
Driving down Mcloughlin, proceeding to the Morrison bridge and exited onto i5 North to Seattle around 2:45am. 
I HOPE TO FUCK YOU DIDNT END UP FUCKING KILLING SOMEONE. 
On Mcloughlin I was going 40, and you were coming in HOT behind me and i literally had to put my foot to the floor to avoid you smashing into the back of me. Couldn’t swerve, someone was next to me. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCKERY??? I’ve literally never experienced almost being rear ended without any braking involved. 

You were ALL OVER the road, and fucking speeding 

You could’ve killed me and my wife last night. 
You scared the absolute shit out of me. 
I hope you didn’t hurt anyone and hopefully you got to where you were going safely because it was obviously important enough to put the entire public in danger. 

You’re going to kill someone.


To the driver…If for some crazy reason you ever end up coming across this post, DM me. I will give you my contact info so next time you’re too fucked to drive, you’ll have someone to call. You could’ve killed my wife and I, I’ll give a stranger a ride so someone doesn’t die, no question. 
Fuck, I’ll give you Uber money dude.

***This is for cheese pizza only***


1. Scottie’s: great sauce and decent cheese but the crust is awful. It legitimately tastes like a tortilla.  5.9

2. Pizza thief: embarrassing pizza. Sour crust, no sauce, and terrible cheese. 4.2

3. Dimo’s: cooked well but the ingredients are meh and it’s a meh pizza. 5.5

4. Baby Doll: of the recommendations Baby Doll is by far the best but it’s not amazing. Solid 7 but it’s nothing special.

5. Straight from New York: crust is a bit boring and the pizza is under cooked. If it was cooked properly I’d rate it around 7 but 6.2 for execution. 

Here for another week, please give me some recommendations that will restore my faith in PDX pizza.

So I stopped and got him in my car so he wouldn't get hit or run off to far. He had a phone number but no address on his collar. Borges doesn't have anywhere to pull off unless it's in someone's driveway, so I go 2 miles down to a store with small parking lot on foster road. I probably could have found a spot on foster road but I didn't want to be blocking the road at all or be in a driveway. It's like a 5 minute drive from where I found the dog to the store. I call the guy and tell him I'm pretty sure I've got his husky. He's says oh shit he must have slipped off his line. I tell him where I'm at and explain why I didn't stop sooner and I say I'll drive him back up to your house if you want, not a big deal. He gets mad at me for driving ""so far from his house"" and says he's going g to meet me at the store anyways. He pulls in screeches to a stop jumps out and throws open his door for his dog. The dog didn't want to get in so he kinda just threw it in the back. Didn't even say thank you or anything. Then says next time just leave his dog or take it to the pound. How was I supposed to know exactly where the dog came from? Was I wrong to drive 2 miles with the dog and then call him? Even after offering to drive back? If I see this dog again should I leave in the middle of the road or should I pick him up and take him to the pound?  The guy was such an asshole, I thought I was just being nice and doing the right thing ",12,PDX

13p383u,Mental Health Awareness Comedy Show,12,1684789339.0,"Hello,

I'm writing to inform you that Mentally Chill - Standup Comedy Celebrating Mental Health Awareness Month has been cancelled. This is dreadful and embarrassing news. Yesterday, the landlord shut down the theater effective immediately. Why? I have no idea and this couldn't have been worse timing. 

### Getting a refund

*Eventbrite will be issuing a refund to everyone who has prepaid.*

### Check in for updates

*Curious Comedy Theater & Funhouse Lounge would like to accommodate this event in the future and I think both are great choices.* 

I am so incredibly sorry to everyone who was looking forward to a great night of comedy and especially Central City Concern! I would still like to produce a benefit show for CCC Portland.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hello, I'm hosting a comedy event in honor of mental health awareness month (Friday, May 26, Juicebox Theater- doors at 7). Proceeds benefit Central City Concern as they have helped me out so many times with mental health and comprehensive well being. More information is in the eventbrite link below. I'm also sharing a promotional article written by myself about mental health in comedy. Thank you for your support!

Has anyone been able to get through?,2,1678747140.0,"Tried using this service for the second time ever (the first time about a year and a half ago resulted in them sending police despite my telling them that the person in crisis was not being violent at all). First of all the number that I used last time went to 311 and they basically hung up on me after saying they didn’t do street response. Basically was trying to get help for a woman who was having a mental health crisis on the street. Waited on hold for 20 minutes before finally giving up. I noticed that when you first call the number it has a very long introduction, followed by the exact same excessively lengthy introduction entirely in Spanish (instead of the usual, “por Español prima a número dos” phrase). Perhaps I’m just paranoid, but it just seems like it took more and more roadblocks to actually connecting people with the seemingly ghost of a street response team, by putting in more and more roadblocks. I have read about the idea that the 911 dispatchers being in the police unions, not wanting to dispatch them for fear that it could threaten their jobs, just wondering if anyone has actually one, been able to reach the street response unit and have them come out and two, what was your experience?",2,PDX

On Saturday the family grabbed a tree and headed to Fernill park for a quick moment with the dog.  Standing at the SE corner we heard a cacophony of car horns coming North on 42nd - they turned and headed towards the park.  What is this? A low-rent funeral procession? A team celebration for winning something?  Some weird new car-horn kink? It certainly is an auditory assault on a nice day at the park!

The second car in the procession had an open hatch and a speaker facing out the back. Because the speaker is, you know, facing BACKWARDS it is only as the car gets 150'+ past us that we can make out what the person is telling us ... something about keeping the streets safe, that we aren't waving, that we're a bunch of racists for not waving.  WTF? I'm a racist for watching your little parade and trying to figure out why you are there?  Turns out the LAST car is flying two flags, one of which is BLM.  OH...

Your execution is incredibly poor! Please, flags at the front - and preferably a banner that faces forward - maybe even signs on the side of your car (a kindergartner can help you with that) so onlookers KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Omnidirectional speakers ...or at least understand that people can't hear you until you're well down the road.

The current projects I have in mind are:  

* A stolen vehicle spreadsheet that folks can reference, compiled from reddit posts (and possibly nextdoor, craigslist, etc)  

* An interactive chart of Portland's agencies and bureaus and the services they provide  

* A list of Apps that you can download and use to stay up to date about various conditions (crime, weather, health concerns, etc) in the Portland area  

* Free or very affordable skill building classes that teach life saving techniques, like CPR/First Aid, mental health awareness, strategies for crisis intervention and suicide prevention, natural disaster response, etc...  

* Objective data mapping for things like crime statistics and city responses to promote informed discourse

My idea is to record a brief 1-3 minute trailer, once that is done, I will post it on GoFundMe and try to make a professional movie that will be entered in Film Festivals.

*All Actors need to have the ability to cry on command.

Actors Needed

Nessa (23) - Scrawny African American woman who is wise beyond her years, but still has a lot to learn. 

Maggy (6) - Small white girl. Extremely optimistic and hopeful, but is starting to show signs of bi-polar disorder.

Lenny (30-40's) - (Any Ethnicity) Caring child protective service officer. 

Pea (30-40's) - (Any Ethnicity) Child Psychologist and wife of Lenny. Pea is very observant and intelligent, but doesn't come off as overly smart.

Marge (30's) - White woman. Marge is the adult version of Maggy. Marge is a very loving woman, when it comes to her kids. She is very stressed and tired all the time. 

Grant (30's) - (Any Ethnicity) Marges Husband who is basically her 3rd child. He has depth and emotion, but he hides it a lot.

Of course, these are very broad versions of the character. If you would like to know more, or if you're interested in the project and getting your name and acting credits out there email me: justinmichaels97@gmail.com

I know it's very hot outside, and dry ice plus a fan might seem like a good solution. You CAN use it, but if you do, please put it inside of a tightly sealed flexible airtight container like a heavy vacuum sealed bag, and blow the fan over that instead. The bag will contain the sublimated CO2, and - you know - not kill you.

I recommend a small chunk of dry ice per large sealed container, so the container doesn't burst as the CO2 sublimates.

Be safe today, friends.

EDIT: Also, please be aware that opening your fridge or freezer will not cool down your home.

My question is why is the local government so ineffective with the homeless, garbage and protesting violence?  The metro area is a wreck with so much garbage and homeless.  It's so depressing to be there the week I'm there vs. the experience I have in here in the Midwest.  I don't want to debate the differences between the Midwest and PDX.  What I want to understand is why PDX is sliding downhill so fast.",7,PDX

I only just found out that the Beaverton PD *doesn’t* run plates until after a car is towed, which could leave an owner of a stolen-and-dumped car on the hook for towing and impound fees, which really sucks. There has been two tow notices slapped on it so far, but the PD doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to move it.

       Oregonians are better off when they can safely travel to cities for concerts, deliver goods for small businesses, and count on county roads being well maintained and free of potholes. 

 Funny because last time i checked, Pham is in bed with the DSA and bike activists who actively *remove* vehicle lanes used for commerce *and* are anti-business. I’m sure most of this money will go to Trimet and “upgrades” instead of desperately needed maintenance. I also thought it was odd she said “county” roads instead of city, as PBOT has ignored our potholes for years now. The rabid spandex squad has also prevented the Rose Quarter improvement projects. What a joke. These officials need to stop pretending like they care about low-income and “working families.”

The beans were something like $20 for a 12oz bag, but I specifically remember one that was chocolate and rose(and maybe something else), but they had a lot of flavor blends like that(another one had orange and hazelnut). The bag was a matt black, no busy graphics. I've been craving it for over a year now. I know this is all pretty vague but maybe it'll ring a bell for someone.

edit: adding that I'm fairly certain there was no cursive used, and was overall very minimalist. It had an old newspaper style font, vaguely fancy.

IT'S BEEN FOUND: It was Coava. My memory got totally donked. The packaging I was thinking of was two tones of green split down the middle. I'm assuming they changed it or it's specific to certain blends. It also might have been the ""pomegranate, rosé, dark chocolate"" so another thing I mostly remembered wrong🤷🏼

1nv05hq,Vet recommendations in Portland-metro,12,1759297443.0,"We moved from Kansas City, Missouri to Portland this past year, and are looking for vet recommendations. It’s been an adjustment to find a vet here that has the same level of care as our KC vet. 

BACKSTORY: Our 13 year old dog was being seen at Brooklyn Yard Vet Hospital. His regular initial appointment was fine and he’s had minimal-to-no health issues his entire life. We’re used to his vets being an all-in-one stop for regular check-ups, surgery, and emergency visits.

He suddenly got a host of GI issues: loss of appetite, vomiting, and loose feces. It took 2 weeks, a $500 visit at Brooklyn Yard, $1500 visit at Tanasbourne ER, then $5500 visit at Pacific NW ER where he was diagnosed with a GI intestinal disease.

A few months later, he got a giant lump on his throat, was unable to eat or drink, and was screaming in pain. 

Brooklyn Yard had no openings to see him for 2 weeks, Tanasbourne charged us $1500 for meds to keep him stable, ultrasound and aspirate with no diagnosis. We were told to be referred to other ERs in the area for imaging and all of them required us to pay $5-7k upfront minimum for an emergency visit. $10-15k minimum for a neurologist. The earliest appointments were 2 weeks away. 

I felt like I was begging vets to see him, even just his regular vet or any other vet at Brooklyn Yard. I called 10+ vets in the metro and it felt like a dead end. 

We ended up sending all of his tests to his past Kansas City vet who diagnosed him with lymphoma within 30 mins of seeing his imaging and pathology results, at no cost to us. We had to put him down days later and feel like we put him through so much unnecessary suffering. We are traumatized by our experience and want to find a regular vet for his fur sister. 

Surgery with our vet in Missouri would cost around $1-3k at most with imaging, medication, and operation included. Is this unrealistic? :( 

TLDR; Is there a vet in the Portland-metro that you can rely on to see your pet in a pinch? Someone who does surgery, imaging, etc, or do all vets refer their patients to specialists? Affordable?

We are willing to travel 1-1.5hrs out for a vet that’s worth it.

Bonus points if they also do holistic care. His KC vet had dog PTs, masseuse, chiropractors, and more. 

Thank you in advanced!!

Edit: This is also not to shame any of the vets mentioned. They took care of our pups and did the best of their ability—we’re just looking for something of the same caliber as our vet in KC and more all-in-one (if possible).",12,PortlandOR

1nt0m9g,Live in NW/downtown Portland or 10-15min drive from downtown in bigger & cheaper apt?,18,1759095913.0,"So I'm moving to Portland soon, and I can't decide where to live. I'm coming from Medford, OR, and I've been daydreaming about walking in walkable neighborhoods/downtown areas, getting coffee etc... but I'm apartment searching on a budget. So I'm looking mostly at 1 bedrooms under $1300/mo.

Anyways, I've found a few options with some options in the NW/Alphabet district, a few just outside downtown lines next to PSU, and some that are in the Multnomah Village area.

The best bang for my buck option I found is a 1bd 1bath apt 580sq/ft with 1 parking spot included for $1100/mo in the Multnomah Village area (10-15mins from downtown). After that there's apt options next to PSU just outside downtown lines for around $1200/mo with 500sq/ft and street permit parking. Last is NW/Alphabet district apartment options at $1300/mo to live in a smaller 400-500sq/ft apartment, but walkability is amazing. Street parking is more risky for break-ins here, though.

Anyways, is the walkable neighborhood in NW worth the extra $200/mo in costs? Or would it not feel like I miss anything from living a 10-minute drive away from downtown?

I 100% want my car, so I have to take into account parking costs. Would a middle-ground location, like being close to PSU, but not directly in a walkable neighborhood, be a good option? I also work 100% remote, which is why the size of the apt is a concern for me.

I get that I can only know what I really want for myself, but I want your opinions on how you feel about that trade-off personally. I mean, what I really want is to be able to afford a 1 bd at $1500-1600/mo & apt parking costs in NW or Pearl area, but I'm a year off from that at the minimum.",78,PortlandOR

1nrtsfx,Are traumatic arrivals to Portland common?,0,1758975553.0,"Hi Portland, let me introduce myself.

I arrived in late 2015 as a college-educated young woman from the East Coast in my late 20s. My father, who was from Europe, had just died traumatically, and I was escaping domestic abuse from my American mother and her family. I was in a highly distressed state, going in and out of stress-induced psychosis from untreated PTSD.

I didn’t really understand what I was walking into but immediately became a victim of crime. I was nearly sex trafficked after being drugged. I remember somehow being in Old Town and becoming non-verbal. The man with me was taking my phone, wallet, and ID—this was happening **in front of a doorman at Stag Bar who did absolutely nothing.**

I finally snapped out of it and ran. He chased me all the way to Burnside Bridge, where I saw a cop car and collapsed, thinking I was safe. Instead, I woke up in jail, being cavity searched, charged with “disturbing a peace officer,” and stripped of my underwear.

I was released, then placed in a psych ward to stabilize. While there, I learned there was a warrant for my arrest because I missed a court date while still in the ward. My family decided to abandon me in Portland and never contacted my European relatives.

I ended up with the first safe man I met, as many vulnerable people do, and had to heal my brain in the same city that traumatized me.

Then the pandemic hit. When I tried reconnecting with my mom, she tricked me into a sober living house in another state. I escaped through another psych ward and made my way back to Portland.

Now I feel lost and stuck. I’ve been here on and off for years but never felt like I’ve truly *lived* in this city. I’ve been taken advantage of while seeking friendship. People want my money. I’ve been screamed at by bus boys for not knowing I had to bus my table (BTW, bussed my own table in Bingen and they were very confused and I had to apologize that I was from Portland).  I’ve even been accused of being from California and to go back there, though I’ve never even been there.

Recently I was diagnosed with CPTSD. I had been self-medicating with heavy cannabis use to try and re-expose myself to life, but it makes me prone to psychosis. On the positive side, while recovering I pursued a self-directed “master’s equivalent” in computer science. I have real skills and capabilities, but stepping into full self-agency still feels excruciating, but I want it badly.

I guess I’m posting this because I don’t want to feel invisible anymore. Has anyone else felt like an outsider here even after years? Are there safe communities, peer groups, or spaces in Portland where people with trauma can actually connect without being exploited? I'm not queer presenting and people seem to not want me in a lot of spaces here.

Thanks for listening.",14,PortlandOR

1nrn5h2,"GameStop at Eastport, and a sad fan",69,1758951100.0,"Tl;dr- the GM of this store dicked over a sweet fan of a game, leaving him SOBBING over what was supposed to be a FREE game code

This morning I tried to pick up a stupid free Pokemon code at GameStop for myself and my kid brother before dropping my fianceé off at work. The place was a madhouse which I should've expected, and in my fury at the handling of the release, I missed the saddest interaction I've ever witnessed. 

The store decided to arbitrarily set a policy to charge a $15 minimum to hand out the *free* codes for the game. 

A cashier, whom I am certain is the GM of that store enforced this rule for everyone besides anyone who stood their ground wanting to avoid an argument. 

A very sweet larger man in a blue hoodie was in line ahead of us, and went up to ask for the code. The GM denied him, the man in the blue hoodie begged, *begged* her for the code- he brought his switch, he tried to show her his thousand hours in his game. This is someone who *CLEARLY* loved his game and just wanted his free shiny pokemon, promised by all the advertising. She denied him with the fakest saccharine ""sorry *sweetie*"", and went right back to mechanically pitching their stupid pro program to everything with a pulse. 

I got my code, furious at the change in policy and left, but my fianceé saw this poor gentleman **SOBBING** on the planter/bench outside of the nearby Subway. I regret spending a penny there, much less for something that should've been FREE. 

I know this is some stupid rant over a pokemon gift code, but if anyone knows that guy, let me know so I can give him mine. 

And please PLEASE, don't spent a **cent** at that store. ",30,PortlandOR

In particular, Angelita Morillo denounced TriMet for collaborating with the University of Washington, which did a study in 2023 showing the extent of low-level drug contamination on MAX trains.

The study showed that:

*According to the tests, 100% of sampled surfaces on TriMet light rails tested positive for low levels of meth. Other findings across TriMet found low levels of fentanyl across 37.5% of air samples collected and 50% of surface samples as positive for fentanyl.*

This unnecessarily scared people, you see, and discouraged them from riding TriMet.  TriMet therefore never should havre done the study, or should have at least kept the results secret.

I’m looking for a new tattoo artist, and hoping to connect with someone who’s relatively new to tattooing/apprenticing.

1npspou,Trying to remember the names of my favorite places when I lived there 2000-2004,10,1758760156.0,"TL/DR Edit: I never appreciated Texas until I moved to Portland, where I was taught old honky tonk country music was cool and people were sad my Austin accent wasn’t Texan enough. Now I’m stuck in a Texas hell hole (even Austin is squeezed by this giant red state) and miss the PNW terribly. So, I love all of you strangers for possibly existing in this magical place I experience for 4 years in my mid-twenties. Thank you!

Hi! I’m really longing for my time in Portland today. It’s been over 20 years since I moved back to my hometown of Austin, but the nostalgia is making my heart ache today because I haven’t been back since then. 

I was in my 20s back then, and didn’t learn to like beer until I lived there. I also learned how to play pool and became a pinball addict while I was there. Anyway, I was trying to remember all of my favorite haunts today. 

My home bar was definitely Beulahland and I spent many a regular evening, thanksgiving for orphaned transplants, soapbox derbies, backyard barbecues, camping trips to the coast, and 50s-60s ska/reggae nights with that whole crew (Andrea & Jimmy 💗). 

I also spent a lot of time at Chez What, which had the best bar food I’ve ever had to this day. 

When I was brand new in Portland, I searched for dive bars and went to a place I cannot remember the name of. I think it was on Burnside on the west side. I randomly showed up one night and they were having “trash bag night.” The door guy hands us a trash bag we have to wear as clothing. So we make dresses and put them on. Go inside and there is a fucking slip and slide happening with the bartenders spraying club soda on the ground while people run and slide on the wet floor in their garbage bags. Hilarious times! As gross as this was, that’s when I knew I was in the right city. Anyone know the name of this place?

I was also a 90s swing dance teacher, so I spent a lot of time dancing around town at the Crystal Ballroom, The Laurelthirst with Pete Krebs, that sort of thing and other places I can’t remember. 

I think I went to Billy Ray’s a lot before I moved. It was closer to my NoPo house than Beulahland.

1npqg68,Looking for safer places for long solo bike rides in the city,16,1758753916.0,"I’m a sixty-something retiree. I loved the bicycle life for decades, even working in a shop for many years. Medical issues forced me to retire early. I am \*slowly\* regaining some of my strength and stamina after dealing with Long Covid, and riding my bicycle has been helpful for this. I’d like to begin riding farther than my neighborhood, maybe work my way up to a ten-mile ride.

The challenge is that I’m still way too slow to keep up with a group ride, and many of the places I used to enjoy riding before Covid — the I-205 path, Springwater Corridor, Delta Park path and Marine Drive — are now too sketchy for me to feel comfortable riding alone. I’ve tried bits of the first two and found lots of homeless encampments, spent syringes and human waste (sometimes literally blocking the path) and I really want to avoid the risk and drama.

I’ve mentioned this to a few bicycling friends — who are all younger and healthier than I am — and I’ve grown tired of being told to take more self-defense classes, consider carrying a weapon or just “grow a spine.” (Obviously, I don’t ride with these friends anymore, because I can’t keep up and they generally left me behind when I got really sick.)

I’m trying to stay positive, but it’s hard. And I am not ready to give up on riding. It brings me too much joy.

Looking for suggestions for east side locations to enjoy mellow rides, reasonably near transit in case I need to go multi-modal. A bench where I can take a lunch break would be great. Thanks.",30,PortlandOR

I'm new to Portland and I'm hoping for some guidance from Portlandians on possibly pointing out some jobs that are hiring, I've hit a wall. Recently got laid off, can't extend unemployment. Maybe someone knows about a job that's open, but that might not be posted somewhere. I know that's slim in 2025, but I am in need of a job asap and it's been tough to find something. I've scoured the internet on every known and unknown job site for weeks. I've cold called and visited places, and I've applied for so, so many jobs, but so far no luck.

Thanks to anyone who might throw an idea my way of where to look and apply.  
Here are some qualifications that I have:  
\- I speak four languages. One of them is Spanish, but it's not fluent. My French is from Canada, which I can speak really well. Russian and English I am fluent in.  
\- BA in Psychology, certified in Hypnosis.  
\- worked with vulnerable populations.  
\- managed social media accounts, simple stuff, not full on content creation.  
\- worked in zero-waste consulting for residential homes (not businesses).  
\- worked with a non-profit creating events and finding volunteers. Experience managing volunteers.

I would love to find a job I really care about. I'm very passionate about what I do and care a lot about my work.

If I can enter the creative field or holistic healing field, great.  
However, at this point, I am not picky, I just need it to pay a living wage (around $24/hour+). I have two senior dogs, one of my dogs had cancer removal surgery this year and I haven't been able to catch up on my CCs, but my dog is cancer-free, so that's all that matters. And I'd like for the commute to be 40 minutes, or ideally a lot less, by public transport so I will have the time to walk my dogs properly after work. Hybrid or remote would be great, too.  
I live near Slabtown.  
I also have a lot of experience in restaurants (hosting/serving, not bartending) and grocery stores. A steady full-time server job would be great, but that's been hard to find. I check Poached religiously. Most places at the moment are looking for part-time and without guaranteed hours.

If anyone can throw some leads my way, I would be eternally grateful. Thank you.

1nnrgie,Fun little Comedy/Bingo nights around PDX,23,1758559040.0,"Hi friends, I would like to mention that I run a Comedy/Bingo night called 0-69, where I and another guest-host/comedian call bingo, give out fun prizes that are actually good, and of course there's a round at the end for all of the cash in the pot! 

  
I do them at Ringler's Pub every Tuesday, Migration Brewing (28th and Glisan) on 2nd and 4th Wednesdays, and in St Johns I have one at Over Easy Grill on 1st and 3rd Thursdays (So, this week I have Ringlers and Migration)

It's $9 for three games, which lasts about 90 min, and it's a ton of fun. I always drive home laughing about how absolutely silly I let things get. Please hit me up for any questions! 

Thanks for supporting your local artistic weirdos, Portland

While waiting for the bus on Saturday morning at 6:10, a man approached the stop. He had no shirt on, but an unzipped water resistant (black) jacket with matching water resistant pants. I backed away from the bus stop sign to give him space, he walked onto Macadam, swooped back onto the sidewalk, then settled into a crouch about 25 feet away from me/the bus stop sign. Okay, bit weird. NBD. 

I noticed he had a paper cup without a lid. I think a utility knife was in the cup, but it was still dark so I'm not sure. Again, weird, but, okaaaaay. 

While still crouched, he began to play with matches. He eventually got one to catch fire, started to burn something, but then allowed his entire hand to become engulfed in flames. Uhhhhh. Then made some motions around the cup, put the burning thing on the ground, and dropped down to do a bunch of push-ups (on pavement sparkling with broken glass). 

I immediately moved to the edge of sidewalk, turned on my phone's flashlight and checked the location of the bus. 4 min. I stood facing him so I could watch him. The bus arrived. He did not get on.

I miss smelling spent grain in the air, I miss running along the Willamette and dropping my feet in at the dock. I miss the endless coffee shops, getting lost in Powell's, wandering through the Saturday market. Yeah, I miss seeing people in flannels and beanies or head to toe in Nike or Adidas and chuckling at how on-brand some of the stereotypes are. As I head in for my next piercing or tattoo, or to have my vivid balayage redone :) I miss collectively bracing for 6 months of grey because this is how it is and what we do, then everyone flooding the parks at the first sign of summer. I miss driving to wine country in the valley. I miss free Shakespeare in the parks, and D&D at TPK, and screaming FUCK SEATTLE at soccer games (Thorns are way better than the Timbers lol). I miss having good dive bars, food trucks, and fine dining all scattered across the city. I miss griping about the train stopping 89 times a week, and dusting off my grudge against PBOT every November for Leaf Day. I miss looking out at evergreens and Mt. Hood. I miss hiking around Mt. Hood! Portland has its problems and it can be hard just to make it sometimes, but to me it was always worth it. We struggle but we never give up, politically, economically, or personally.

1nlqghx,Compassion > Crisis,0,1758348321.0,"Muskrats, mules, contemplators and creatures of the night, fall into place as we refute this nations guts in disgrace. Witches, carpenters and worms, squirm into oblivion while the night sinks deep into the dreams of last year. The anonymity, sunk deep within our lungs has left us desperate. Lost. Frameless yet robust with displacement. 



Streets full of losers, time abusers and down on their luck snoozers. While the clock arms progress laterally the air is reminiscent of promise. Echoes of our minds hallway. Frozen in terror we succumb to nothingness and parades in blatant disregard to our blood. How staunch the divide of you and yourself. So comfortable we can line up to complain. Was it the end or the beginning we were longing for? Pull out the answer with your blank faced stare and pause in the distance, softly, amidst fresh autumn air.



Your youth. Your booth. The most dangerous option in the face is the hounds’ tooth. Cunning tongues and sharp razors, day debaters, sideline phasers slinging poetic prophecy surrounded by perceived verbal tasers. Confused and abused but our control remains on cruise - absent option. Although I haven’t lost my voice and I’ll never bow, you can break me in your mind if it makes you proud. Gaps in time. Inherited limits.



When we lose our peripheral what is the price? What currency of complaint are you selling? Who’s willing to be accountable? The answer isn't complex... it's in the main vein right on Broadway. Slept crawlers dividing your peace... piece by piece. Opened eyes are the price. The prize.



It wasn’t long after the rebirth that the humidity set in. Surrounded by performers and tap dancing nonce’s... absent in the wind. We are relentlessly embracing the thought of control. The selfish notion of control. The mechanism in our pocket that abuses our innocence. Go ahead. Take your time.



Nothing adjacent to safety under the guise of film like a naked sheet in the wind. Closed doors and sideline whores abuse the light when they only sleep in darkness. You cannot avoid yourself but of course we'll take your money honey. We know what you need to hear. Be free or be grateful - one’s got less to do with the faithful. We run blind to find a line up to the bent knee that’s been removed... where is matter sourced from?



How can everything be so different and yet so much of it uninspired? When did we conspire? And now our embrace remains in a rampant state of disguise. Bathed and soaked in lies. The bathtub is full and there’s still a line to get in. Drink little piggies. Get your jammies on and swim. Embrace your ineptitude and stare directly into the sun. Back to the shadows with your ideals and shortcomings. Frolic in your pathetic praises and validations. You mean nothing more and nothing less. Whomever told you or didn’t tell you has rearranged your face. Go ahead, reach into your pocket. Pick it up and drink it in. If you didn’t already just agree to these terms and conditions. You are in no position to be anything more and so so so much less. This isn’t a game. You are nothing. It’s not sad or untrue but it is fleeting and undeniable, almost reliable.



Albert our interconnected string. Thank you for the gift of bliss. Vision so timeless and elusive. The reframe. Atomic molecular structures divided... by fiction... whatever you need to believe... at least shout. Holler. Be present enough to threaten the moon in all its glory. Yes, you are enough. Embrace.

1nllvf5,What is the vibe if you can hear music coming from my studio? Are MOST Portlanders quick to call the cops or chill?,0,1758333355.0,"So I’m a touring musician for 20 years, and have had an active recording studio in Nashville for 15 years. Nashville, obviously known as Music City, has literally thousands of home studios. As long as the music is within reasonable hours, I’ve never had any problem with neighbors or noise complaints.  The studio is fairly sound proofed, but at times you’ll be able to hear amps, drums etc, from outside the house. It’s so common around here that no one has ever had a problem, and I’ve never even heard of anyone having the cops called on them for playing, recording or rehearsing bands.
The reason I ask is because my wife and I love the vibe and people so much that we’ve been looking to buy a house and move to Portland. We’re coming back in December to look around more.  One thing I’ve noticed is the neighborhoods are surprisingly quiet compared to Nashville.  I know it’s a case by case scenario (and dependent who the neighbors are).
I’m just trying to get a general consensus. If I move my studio out there, how common is it to hear bands playing? I’ve lived in a couple of towns where anytime I played drums the cops showed up, and I’m just wondering.
Again, it pretty soundproofed and not that insanely loud, and it’s never late in the evening. 
What’s the vibe? I know there is a little bit of a healthy music scene out there?

I’m reaching out here, to both start marketing these workshops and ask if anyone is aware of places I can reach out to for sponsorship/donations for things like art supplies, refreshments for attendees and studio rental fees. I’ve asked google, and have sent a few emails out, but would love any resources that you all might have. 

If you’re interested in my workshop once it’s ready, please respond here and I will keep you in the loop! 

Thank you so much everyone! Have a magical day! ❤️❤️❤️",0,PortlandOR

On my way home at the gas station some 60+? Man waits for me outside of the door next to my car flick his tongue at me does the V with his tongue if you know what I mean. I ignore him walk to my car get in lock the doors. He stands behind my car continuing to do the same thing. Rev My engine and yell at the window I’m gonna fucking run you down so then he walked away. Point being Vancouver has a lot of weirdos.

1nj2ynd,"Denied apartment fue to bad credit score, can I appeal?",0,1758081379.0,"I recently applied to one of Prometheus Apartments but got denied due to bad credit score (522). I just graduated and started an engineer role with an 82k salary, however I was self supporting myself through college, I stopped making payments on a Discover card as I couldn’t afford it and got send to collections.

 One of my parents opened a credit card with my SS without my authorization and didn’t payed it for a long time, another sibling of mine got a cell phone with my SS as well, never payed it back and went straight to collections as well. Most of my small loans have been cleared up and Im planning on paying all the remaining collections this week, asking to be removed from my credit.

The credit card from my parents got marked as delinquent but it’s closed and current now. My current credit card is at 20% but showed up in the last billing cycle as over the limit. 

I know my financial history it’s not the best but I was surviving and living mostly day to day, juggling between two jobs and my classes. I had an apartment before, the lease is still open but in my hometown, with no history of eviction but a  renter’s score of 605. 
I was given 30 days to appeal, some of the recent improvements include:

• Multiple small loans paid off in full this month (receipts available)
• Credit card utilization reduced to 30-44% (not yet reflected due to reporting cycles)
• $5k stipend from a national lab  internship arriving this week to clear remaining debt
• Stable engineering employment with full documentation

As well I am gathering the following supplemental materials for my appeal:

• Employment verification letter and supervisors recommendations
• Lab internship offer letters confirming stipend details
• Recent paystubs and payment receipts for resolved accounts
• Letter confirming incoming stipend payment, as it hasn’t arrived yet
• Updated financial statements

I made a screening deposit  and it’s not refundable, how probable is that after all of this I can get approved?
 
Just recently moved here and I’m staying at a hostal, it’s been a hard couple of weeks and I’m desperate for my own place. I tried checking air bnbs or roommates but they require stays of 3 months or more and I don’t want to be paying rent for something that is not mine:( 

I really loved the complex and the community, it’s close to my work, and friends I’ve made and it has a ton of amenities that are at reasonable price including a sauna, jacuzzi, gym, a community garden and monthly events, yoga classes and pilates every month, kamboucha on tap, and what really sold it for me was the interaction between neighbors and having a security guard that can scort me to the building or my rail stops, as I don’t have a car at the moment and I’m new to the area this made me feel really safe and no other apartment has mentioned anything like this. 
I’m making three times the rent, and besides clearing any debt, I’m offering to pay two months in advance, but it’s still f due to my poor score. Has anyone experience something like this? I still got hope that I can get approved :(",55,PortlandOR

I want to know if the car break-ins are as bad as I keep seeing on reddit.

I loved SF felt and felt safe there. The media really kept saying that SF is lawless and that everyone is in danger there even walking on the streets, which is false. However, leaving a car parked on the street overnight was a gamble there and I felt none of that today while driving in the NW of Portland, it felt pretty safe.

I would like to hear about the rates of car window smashes and break in based on local's experiences, however, I would like to avoid this post turning into a discussion of how the city is handing such occurrences.

1nfcufb,Possible Trafficking,330,1757706364.0,"So within the last two days in Portland I’m pretty sure I’ve been approached by people getting trafficked and trying to recruit more girls. It was two different girls and both of them had an older man with them who just stood behind them as they spoke to me. The first girl came up to me downtown near pot belly’s calling me and my friend pretty and then very eagerly saying she need new friends. I noticed she was with an older man so I immediately got in my car and my friend kept talking to her and got her number. The older guy waved to me while I was sitting in the car and I just ignored him and when my friend got back in the car I told her not to text that number on a real number so she used a fake one and got these messages. The voicemail was pretty concerning I wish I could link the audio on here.

Then last night I was near voodoo donuts at the karaoke bar with the shining inspired bathroom. This time it was another girl again with an older man. I was a little buzzed so I pressed the girl a little bit more and I just kept asking questions like “how did you meet him?” “Are you okay?” I’ve seen this girl with this older man before which I also brought up because it was the same bar I had seen them at a few weeks prior. The man just stood behind her the whole time not saying a word. Both times I’ve seen them she was super messed up but I didn’t engage with her until this time. She asked to take a picture on my phone of me and my friend which I thought was odd. I noticed a phone call to a random number this morning and I’m pretty sure it was during the time of the photos she was taking. She asked for my info so I gave her an old spam account and she followed me. After looking at her second account linked in her bio it was pretty easy to see what she does for work.

When he tried to call, they basically said well this is actually money owed to the county. Another person said  he has to make an online account with the city and complete a long list of forms. The letter says he only has to worry about 2020. The person said he may have to account for several years back. And on and on.

At about 1.7 miles in (where the trail makes a hairpin before going up to the fire road with a sign) I saw an animal leaving the trail headed uphill in front of me. The tricky part is that I'm not completely sure what it was but my first impression was cougar. The more I think about it the more contaminated my memory gets but this is my description: It seemed catlike not doglike and it was big but not as a big as I remember an adult cougar being. Maybe Saint Bernard sized? It had BIG paws and I thought it moved just like a cat. The only problem is it did not have that sleek coat like a cougar but was almost shaggy, reddish I think. Really don't think it was a dog, it didn't crash through the woods but slipped away. I got spooked thinking it was maybe a young cat who might still have a mother around. I stopped running, (you know, prey response etc.) and walked back out.

I can see why eyewitness testimony is shaky. If anyone knows what a bigger than a bobcat smaller than a cougar, reddish slightly shaggy, cat gait creature is please chime in.

The Procedeo contract did not result from a traditional competitive request for proposals. Instead, it is a “cooperative” contract, meaning that the firm has already won a competitive bidding process with another government entity outside of Oregon.

…

But Keisha Locklear, a senior project manager with the Office of School Modernization who has been assigned to work on Jefferson High, blasted the Texas firm. In the nearly three months of their current contract, she said, staff from Procedeo have attended only a small handful meetings, either with the entire team or individual key players, while making promises to Armstrong and other senior leaders that Locklear characterized as virtually impossible to fulfill.

Remember the guy in the blue truck who filmed himself recklessly driving all over the city, breaking laws left and right, and endangering drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians for months?  Despite multiple people contacting police, and it being all over social media, police didn't take it seriously until news picked up on it, and his reckless driving resulted in a crash.

Well, the judge only found him guilty of 3 of 11 charges, despite tons of video evidence (of his own making that he posted on Instagram BRAGGING about it), and ""sentenced Burrell to 18 months bench probation and 80 hours of community service. His license will be suspended for 90 days, but he doesn't have to serve any time in jail. Burrell is also required to attend a victim impact panel and take a high-risk driver course.""

The video has been released, but doesn't have audio and doesn't seem to change the narrative all that much. It's funny how JVP's stance has changed from calling on the DA to release the video because everyone was being racist, to now saying all she was asking for was clarification on whether or not she could release the video. 

Did she contact the DA's office to ask this before trying to put him on blast? Didn't she know she could release the video, as she has done so in the past? 

Racial profiling in law enforcement and the media is a real thing. As a brown person in Portland, I'm acutely aware of how the color of my skin can affect how police and the general public perceive me. But trying to use this incident to hint at racial issues, when clearly none are present, does a great harm to the BiPOC community's efforts to raise awareness of racial inequalities. ",51,PortlandOR

1nckcn3,Establishing North/South Regional Rail,1,1757427900.0,"As someone who is from the Portland area but is going to college in Boston, it is interesting to see how the east coast cities mostly have well-established regional rail systems, but major west coast cities mostly do not. I know this is due to the time periods in which they were developed, however Portland has pretty great urbanism, and I feel as though a regional rail link running north to south could really be a big boost for the region in terms of mobility. The Max provides a decent link east/west, especially if they can figure out a solution to speeding it up downtown. There also is not any other existing infrastructure already in place to provide a faster east/west alternative via regional rail. However, there is the existing rail north/south that is already there and is used by Amtrak and obviously freight. I am curious what the barriers are to establishing initial service from Vancouver through Portland down to Oregon City or Canby? I assume that negotiating usage with the freight railroads would be difficult. There also may be considerable congestion issues. However, most stations are already built, and you could add an infill station to St. Johns. This service could then be expanded north to Kelso and south to Salem. In short, how feasible would it be to use existing rail infrastructure with minimal upgrades to quickly establish a north/south regional rail link initially from Vancouver to Oregon City with headways that would actually make the service a viable alternative to driving?",14,PortlandOR

We recently built a cedar fence and love it. Wondering if anyone has recommendations for how ***or if*** to treat it? I've heard conflicting things from neighbors - some say our weather is brutal for untreated wood and treatment is necessary for a decent lifetime, others say no treatment will withstand our climate anyways and if you treat it it'll need to be re-treated every 3-5 years otherwise the treatment will not only look bad but actually accelerate degradation, so best leave it raw and let nature run its course.   
We don't mind it going grey, just want it to last as long as reasonably possible in our Portland climate!   
I'm also very averse to toxic products, so any sort of carcinogenic or unsafe, unhealthy, or otherwise dangerous, nasty stuff is not an option.

1nbtpjh,One Week Left to Give Input on Portland's Ranked-Choice Elections!,37,1757351737.0,"September 8, 2025

In the 2024 General Election, Portlanders elected their mayor, auditor, and city councilors using ranked-choice voting for the first time. The City’s 2024 election saw 118 candidates qualified to the ballot, resulting in as many as 30 candidates in a single contest.

Having a large pool of candidates for voters to select from to represent the City is a good problem to have. However, findings from post-election data and public feedback demonstrated that the high number of candidates caused various challenges, including:

* Some voters felt overwhelmed
* Some voters skipped contests because they felt uninformed about the candidates
* Candidates struggled to get resources for their campaigns
* Candidates had a hard time reaching voters with crowded forums and events

# Gathering public feedback

The Elections Division is reviewing the candidate filing fee and related policies. Before moving forward with a plan, we want to know what options Portlanders prefer, and how they experienced the first ranked choice voting election.

Please complete the following two-minute survey to indicate which policy you most support and give us your feedback. We are also looking to gather information from this short survey on the best ways to engage with Portlanders in the future.

I didn't believe there was really that much stigma around black cats until I started fostering them and was shocked to find that absolutely no one wanted a black kitten. My white and orange foster kittens found homes almost immediately, but months in and Salem and her other black siblings have had no such luck. 

I thought I'd reach out to try and find some PNW folks who know what it's like to feel like a black cat to see if maybe she can find a home with someone who will truly love her and appreciate her for the incredibly sweet, friendly, and quirky cat she is.

No one who writes these articles must ever ride from airport to downtown or convention center. I counted 30 transient camps along I-84 filled with abandoned cars, discarded appliances, dead animal carcasses, and cascading amounts of debris, lots of evidence of illegal burning. A few airport workers on train leaving PDX. After that stop everyone who got on with shopping carts and trash bags and clearly high or mentally ill. Talking to themselves or shouting. No fares were checked and unlike mass transit in every other major city, the stations are not secured. No fare required to loiter station. From NE 60th stop to downtown hillside covered with massive amounts of trash and every bit of concrete covered with graffiti. At Hollywood stop someone had urinated on the HOP card machine. When you ride from the airport Portland looks like a decaying city. Total lack of results-oriented leadership in this city. Is CLEAN and SAFE really too much to ask? In this city, yes.",72,PortlandOR

For those who didn't see the previous post (before it got taken down by reddit filters after my attempts to edit the post), I am a researcher at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  We are inviting you to participate in an experiment about effects of lighting on people's wellbeing. You'll visit our laboratory in Sellwood for two hours every week over a span of five weeks and you'll be paid with a gift card for your contribution.

**We are especially looking for people with migraines as we hope to improve LED lighting for everyone.** We have a medical doctor assess questionnaire responses to mitigate severe risks to people with migraines. We also provide a dark room, where people can rest and sit comfortably, and we will have water and snacks!

If you are interested, please read the flyer below, and contact Alfiya Orman ( [alfiya.ormanova@pnnl.gov](mailto:alfiya.ormanova@pnnl.gov) ). Let me know if you have any question and we hope to see you!

How about Instead of squeezing more money out of people with parking fees, how about enforcing the leash laws that already exist—especially in places downtown and parks? Put those ticket writers in the parks and start fining people who let their dogs run off-leash.

This isn't just about dog haters. It's about safety, accountability, and respect for public spaces. Responsible dog owners *want* leash laws enforced just as much as people with allergies, small children, or nervous dogs do.

The only ones who will complain are the ones breaking the rules. If you're serious about generating revenue, stop ignoring the blatant violations happening every day in the parks.

My sweet cat did not come home this morning after being let out last night. He is a fairly large/tall black cat with gold to light green eyes. 

He's very friendly but might be scared if you see him. He usually just hangs on my patio and is not usually allowed out overnight.

Hoping he is just hunkered down somewhere waiting out the rain. If you spot him or have seen him in the last \~12 hours please reach out!! 

Thank you so much 🫶

\*I will update as soon as I find him or hear anything\*

1num9y5,Why are there so many photos showing everything but the protest's and the ICE facility?,0,1759259589.0,"
Hey everyone, I'm a 19-year-old from out of state trying to get a real sense of what's going on in Portland, and I'm seeing two completely different stories. On the one hand, I see videos of intense protests, especially the ones around the ICE facility. But on the other hand, whenever those posts get popular, the subreddit seems to get flooded with beautiful pictures of sunsets, parks, and quiet neighborhoods, with people arguing that the ""war zone"" narrative is fake.
This is confusing to me because I'm from Memphis. If I wanted to ""prove"" that Memphis has no crime, I could just post a bunch of pictures of the wealthy, safe suburbs like Germantown or Collierville. But that wouldn't be the full, honest picture of my city.
So, I'm trying to understand the logic here. It seems like showing only the nice parts of a city to deny that there are also parts with serious, real problems is a dishonest way to argue. At what point does fighting what you see as one kind of misinformation become its own kind of misinformation by deliberately leaving out the full context? Isn't that misinformation, too?

While everyone’s (rightfully) focused on all the other chaos, the state quietly pushed through this road-funding bill without even letting us vote on it. More taxes, higher prices like we aren’t already getting hit with the cost of living here.

And for what? The roads aren’t even being maintained as it is. It feels shady as hell that something this big can just get passed without anyone having a say.

Edit: copy-paste from opb below:

Raise the state’s 40-cent-per-gallon gas tax to 46 cents beginning in January. That change is expected to raise around $90 million per year.

Hike vehicle title and registration fees that Oregon motorists pay. Registration fees would increase by $42, and titling fees by $139. Electric vehicles, which do not pay gas taxes, would be required to pay an additional $30 on top of existing fees.

Double the payroll tax that currently takes 0.1% out of workers’ paychecks to support public transit. The increase was initially expected to be ongoing, but Democrats agreed to limit it to two years under pressure from Republicans.

Require drivers of electric vehicles and hybrids to enroll in the state’s OReGo program, which charges drivers for miles driven. Such a shift is considered necessary for funding road projects as EVs continue to gain popularity and gas tax revenue is expected to decline.

Require more frequent auditing of the Oregon Department of Transportation so lawmakers have better insight into the progress and cost of major road projects.

Then we went in 2024 and it was a ghost town.  Went there again this weekend and saw signs of growth with actually interesting shops.  Big kudos to Stoopid burger, jumbos pickleball, and the second hand pet store.  It’s also still one of the only places with a public ice rink in Portland.

Do y’all think Lloyd Center can continue this, or is it doomed like all malls?  Secondly, when I read about the James beard food hall struggling to open downtown, I’m kind of thinking they should try Lloyd center first to prove concept.

This morning around 1030 I had my cargo ebike stolen from my garage. Maybe 20 minutes later our neighbors found a nice looking road bike (gray fuji with clip in pedals) dumped in front of their house along with some drug paraphernalia (nice). Pretty sure the other bike was also stolen, just 'upgraded' with ours. 

  
I've done the police report and logged the bike on all the usual sites, but this was mine and my kid's primary transportation and we're really hoping to find it. When it was stolen both our helmets were attached--gray adult helmet and light blue toddler helmet with stickers :'( -- but they've probably been dumped somewhere.

The bike has some identifying features, most notably a big child frame/seat (""caboose"") on the back and basket on front. The picture with this post is missing the basket and a seat pad that have since been installed. Also, my heavy duty kryptonite brand chain lock was wrapped and locked around the frame so it's unlikely the thief will be able to resell anywhere half decent. About 1050 miles on it as of this Friday, unless thief has a charger the battery will probably die at 1080 so at least hopefully this inconveniences the thief as the bike is heavy AF and barely moves without the motor.

  
Adding picture of the found bike too, holding on to it for a day or so to see if it belongs to any neighbors, before handing over to police.
