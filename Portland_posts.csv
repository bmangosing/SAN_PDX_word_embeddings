I saw the SUV (that also ran a red light!) that tried to parallel park and hit a car at OHSU South Waterfront near the aerial tram.  I stopped to take pictures but the owner came out and took some.  I gestured towards the woman who did it but I had a bit of a time sensitive issue to deal with and kind of took off.  I'm sorry, I should have stuck around, but I can be a witness and did take a few photos.  ",0,Portland

How are there not regulations against this?,0,1758830951.0,"11 Hours ago, Blueground just posted 30+ apartments for rent in the Portland area. All are high-end, ""luxury"" apartments. Each is 3x-4x the average cost of a rental of a similar size (7k-12k for 3-4bd apts). I anticipate that this will lead to rent hikes in all the neighborhoods these rentals are located. I am mostly wondering whether anyone else is seeing this and concerned about the negative impacts this will have on Portland neighborhoods. If so is there anything that can be done?",8,Portland

She saw this dog trotting alone, dragging a leash. She picked up the leash and walked around with it for about 30 minutes looking for an owner with no luck.

The humane society requires you to bring the dog to them and she's commuting on her bike today. She doesn't want it to get ran over but also has to go back work. Is there a rescue or a shelter that picks up dogs? Is someone able to pick it up from downtown?

1npjbi7,Expect your PDX water bill to be 6.3% higher (and how to help),203,1758737037.0,"I checked but didn't see a previous post about this. Portland Water Bureau raised rates on July 1 (as they do every year).  If you haven't gotten a quarterly bill since then, here's a reminder to expect it to be higher.

The reasons for these rate increases have been covered in previous threads, but are also [described](https://www.portland.gov/water/customer-service/pay-your-utility-bill/what-your-bill-pays) on PWB's website. (TL;DR: Deferred infrastructure and maintenance, and \*gestures broadly at the economy\*)

Ways to mitigate the impact on your wallet from easiest to hardest:

1. Contact PWB & switch to monthly billing. They still only read the meter every 3 months, but they divide that bill up into 3 equal(ish) payments over 3 months.
2. Sign into your account and make sure you're signed up for Clean River Rewards if eligible (even if you signed up for it years ago- they reset the system a year or two ago and we had to re-signup).
3. If you're still paying by card (debit or credit), they started charging the card processing fee a few months ago. Set up a ""bill pay"" from  your online bank account (your bank sends them money), ACH/payment on your PWB account (PWB draws from your bank), ... or start sending checks in the mail with a stamp, whatever floats your boat.
4. **Even if you are a renter**, [get the water free efficiency kit from PWB](https://www.portland.gov/water/water-efficiency-programs). DO NOT SLEEP ON HOW MUCH MONEY (WATER) YOU CAN SAVE BY CHANGING YOUR AERATORS! If you have a 2.5 gallon per minute (gpm) showerhead (standard since 1992), switching to the 1.5 gpm will save you FORTY PERCENT of your shower water use. Even if you only have a 2 gpm (""water sense"" labelled), it will still save you TWENTY FIVE percent. Ditto with kitchen sink aerator. Tenants can easily do these changes, you just need a towel and possibly an adjustable wrench or vise grip if it's really stuck on. (Caveat: a lot of newer sink faucets have either a proprietary ""key"" that you need to get the aerator out, that you can buy the key online; or they require a different kind of aerator, which in many cases you can still get from a big box store online for $4-7.)
5. Hopefully you don't have any leaks, but if you do, fix it with the above free kit and/or call a professional. Then ask PWB for a refund (they will refund some cash for fixed leaks)
6. PWB has info about [deferring bills](https://www.portland.gov/water/customer-service/pay-your-utility-bill/request-payment-arrangement) & [financial assistance](https://www.portland.gov/water/customer-service/apply-financial-assistance) on their page. Eligibility for financial assistances starts at $52,128/year or less gross income for a single person, $67,020 for a family of 3, etc.
7. If you're a homeowner or otherwise fairly settled long term, consider investing $100 or so in a timer and a soaker hose for your summer seasonal garden beds and trees. When you're re/planting any yard areas, consider adding trees to shade plants and reduce their water use (and lower your cooling bill), and natives from the Portland Plant List, which will generally require little or no water if you plant them in areas similar to their usual habitat. (If you have a dry, hot, exposed area, plant plants from section 2.7 and 2.8a ""prairie"" and ""dry rocky outcrops."" If you have a dry shady area under trees, section 2.1 ""western hemlock-douglas fir forest."" Etc.",75,Portland

1np8e28,59 Dogs at the Troutdale Shelter!,223,1758709098.0,"Dear Portlanders, the Multnomah County Animal Shelter has 59(!) dogs right now. That is the most I have ever seen. They are a kill shelter fyi. Anyone looking for a new friend or family member? Or has anyone ever considered fostering for them? Or volunteering to walk dogs?

Oregon Humane Society and Oregon Dog Rescue, for example, have much better systems for volunteering, fostering, and adopting, but these dogs at MCAS are just as deserving and really need us.  
  
Check them out: [MCAS dogs](https://www.multcopets.org/adoptables?adopt%5B0%5D=species%3ADog&page=1)

ETA: since some people prefer to live in their fairytale world, to be considered a “no kill shelter,” a shelter must have a 90% live rate or higher. They have been under 90% for a few years and removed “no kill” from their website. You can check the stats on their website and there is an article I will find about this. Their official euth policy of 3/24 mentions considering kennel capacity, limited options for transfer or foster, available resources, etc

Update: there are now 62!
  
Anyway, here are a few of their sweet faces:

Used it the evening prior but found it gone the next day with the lock cut and the AirTag I'd placed  in a pretty hidden spot was found trashed in a garden near 33rd street.

I've been checking online marketplaces like Facebook and eBay with no luck and would be super grateful for any tips or if you happen to see it listed, dumped, or for sale!! The bike was in pretty good condition except for a small scratch on the display, super scuffed up pedals, and had the rubber charging port missing last I saw/used it.

Day 1:  
Flew in from SFO, ended up driving down to Eugene to watch the Emeralds play (big SF Giants fan). Drive there reminded me a lot of the Central Valley back in CA.

Day 2:   
Went to Screen Door for brunch. The shrimp and grits were terrific! Didn't realize how much food it was going to be or I wouldn't have ordered the fried okra but was not mad about it at all. Explored Hawthorne Street afterwards and went thrifting. Didn't find anything I liked (I guess I'm not en vogue) but still loved walking around the neighborhoods. Also extremely appreciate how easy your public transit is! Although I would love a little faster headways. For dinner, I was able to snag a reservation at Langbaan and it was absolutely terrific! Patrick and Molly were lovely and I loved the info on each dish as it was presented.

Day 3:  
Had breakfast at Cheryl's which was probably the weakest of all the meals I had (I know it was controversial on here but decided to try anyways). Just overpriced and meh. But afterwards, I went up to the Rose Test Garden as well as the Japanese Garden and I LOVED both. I found myself coming back to the rose garden a couple times in my explorations on this day and it was an instant mood lifter. Dinner today was at Ox Restaurant which I think was my favorite out of the trip. Forget the gentleman's name who was serving but he was excellent. The tres leches cake for dessert was worth the trip alone! Afterwards, I met up with friends at Scandals(sad that it's closing), and then we went to Silverado and closed at Stag.

Normally the swifts would overnight in hollow snags (standing dead trees), but with the wholesale destruction of most of our old growth forest--and therefore the big, dead trees they need--they've had to adapt to chimneys instead since the 1980s.

As always, it was a picnic atmosphere, with people of all ages sitting on the lawn to watch the swifts dive into the chimney at dusk. There were kids playing soccer, and some amateur acrobats, and as darkness began to fall someone began tossing a glowing foam Nerf ball around. While we waited for the swifts to arrive, we enjoyed the large numbers of crows winging their way overhead as they went en masse to their favorite roosting spots.

And the swifts! I think we counted a flock of at least 400, and more kept coming. I wasn't keeping a really close count, but it easily could have been twice that number with stragglers by the time all was said and done. The biggest flock murmurated like starlings, and a couple of times a hapless crow got caught up in the traffic, an oversized hanger-on entangled with the smaller swifts. They seemed to take longer to go into the chimney, with a few still struggling to find a spot as it got dark, but that may be because they weren't as used to this chimney, or perhaps the mouth wasn't as amenable to easy landings as the one at Chapman. But they all made it in eventually.

*This* is my Portland. This is why I love it here. There are so many people here whose idea of a good time is to sit on a wide grassy lawn with a picnic and a few friends, watching this crowd of tiny insectivorous birds angle their way into an old chimney, cheering every time some of them funnel their way in for a safe landing. I moved here almost two decades ago, and overwhelmingly this has been my experience here. Yes, there are problems, as any city has, but the media overblows this to get clicks and views and create outrage and fear, and people are more likely to speak up with complaints than with praises.

The important thing is to show up for the good stuff, be a part of what you want to see in the community. Let your self-fulfilling prophecy be a positive one.",29,Portland

1nmrvaa,Smoked Out of My Apartment,22,1758461027.0,"Edit: I have an air purifier. All it does is flash red that the air quality is s*** 

I live in a non-smoking Hud apartment complex, and I've been looking for a place to live due to 2nd hand smoke, but none of the apartments are accessible as I use a power chair or Walker.  My current apartment is not habitable due to the smoke - I am in and out of the ER and urgent care and have recently been giving an inhaler due to the constant secondhand smoke in my apartments .

I talked to an attorney and I have no legal recourse against a permissive landlord who does nothing to smokers.  The only thing I could do is file the tort against the neighbors who are smoking. This won't give me my health back, or find a safe place to live.
There are many of them (smokers) and it would do meNo good to sue sue, I just need to get away from the smoke. It's making me sick and my cat sick. I've even called homeless shelters but they won't let me stay because I have an apartment to stay in. 

I thought about buying a cheap van to live in until I can find another apartment, but then there's the whole hassle of parking and safety as a disabled woman sleeping in a van. 

I can pay up to 1,200/month.  Anything I haven't thought of? Tia 🤔",65,Portland

1nmb7xy,Proposal to Revitalize Urban Plaza Downtown,50,1758406566.0,"Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share a passion project of mine that I've been working on, using some of the things I've learned while studying Urban Planning at PSU and hoping to drum up some public support for this campaign.

I'm asking for support in revitalizing the 6th Avenue Fountain Plaza—known to skateboarders as “Half Circle.”

For over 40 years, skateboarders have used this space, but the presence of skate stoppers and other barriers currently limits its potential. Skateboarding fosters creativity, community engagement, and brings economic benefits by increasing foot traffic to local businesses.

I propose a phased approach to improve the Plaza:

Phase 1: Remove existing skate stoppers;

Phase 2: Remove boulders, invest in landscaping improvements, and introduce small, skateable elements.

Additionally, I recommend adding bike racks, seating, a water fountain and other amenities to support sustainable transportation and enhance the experience for all users.

If you feel moved to support this project please consider adding your name to the list of 166 people who have already signed on by filling out this brief Google survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6vcQoWCVQAnUqHLoJTKESmJNegvHYKSf8Jcr-ltLX8Nplvw/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6vcQoWCVQAnUqHLoJTKESmJNegvHYKSf8Jcr-ltLX8Nplvw/viewform)

There is also a section on that form, which is optional, where you can share any vision you have for the space. Feel free to dream big! No bad ideas. I know it's reddit, but I just ask that if you do fill out the form we try to keep the discourse positive, feel free to tear this apart in the reddit comments if you feel the need lol.

The idea is to use skateboarding as a tool to help reactivate this space, but my hope is that a vibrant Half Circle provides as many uses for as many people as possible.

Thanks!

It feels so futile to complain about given how so much of it is a result of bureaucratic decision making and special session delays, but I really worry that someone is going to get killed one of these days. Not to mention all the trash on the shoulders that ODOT doesn’t seem to clean anymore even though the layoffs have been postponed.

Hi there I work at Edwards Vacuum! We are / were a major sub-fab equipment supplier for Intel. They aren't buying systems anymore. We had several rounds of layoffs this year and a furlough. On Tuesday we were notified that only a quarter of us were to remain employed. Everyone else was dismissed that day! We were all given our termination date. Some of us will be gone by November, others by June of next year.

I am a software engineer that works here and my heart is completely ripped out by all of this. Our facility was beautiful, and it was a wonderful working environment. I've worked here for 4 years. I started as an intern and I've made so many memories and friends here. I think our ghosts will forever haunt this building whoever buys it.",52,Portland

1njnnw2,An Obituary for Lito (Or; The Guy Who Couldn't Play Guitar in Pioneer Square),1418,1758139341.0,"August 29^(th), one of our own passed on.  Some of you youngin’s with your new ways of smoking from anything other than a can may not remember him, but there used to be a legend in Pioneer Square—on the corner in front of the Nordstrom Café.  He wore blue latex gloves, a blue hoodie, and rocked a blue Pignose guitar with a built-in amp.  And God was it awful.  He played day and night—for years—decades even—but he never got any better.  He strummed every string he could in 4/8 time.  Didn’t matter where the other hand was on the neck.  All you’d hear when you got close to that corner above the traffic and the screech of the MAX and the homeless was the only song he knew by heart.  TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG—

 

His name was Joselito Abuan.  But my wife and her family called him Tito Tambo.  He was born in the Philippines, in Makati, back in 1961.  Lito wasn’t always like this.  Shouting about how he was a 5-star general and had land in Switzerland.  Believe it or not, he was a prodigy in chess.  Looked forward to becoming an engineer.  And as the only son of 6, his father looked to him like a rising star.  Then back in the 80’s, he moved to Portland with the rest of his family.  He tried to find a pot connection quickly rather than safely, and ended up losing his head.  From the sounds of it, he got a hold of some bad acid which kicked some latent schizophrenia into overdrive.

 

Unfortunately, Lito’s folks were willing to save a buck (“No no,” they’d say, “They just thought he’d do better back home.”  Say what you will).  Lito was sent back to the Philippines, a place known for their incorruptible leadership and understanding of mental illness.  He was sent to jail.  However long he was there was too long.  When he came back to America, he vowed not to return to the old country, and his father vowed that he would be the only caretaker his son would ever need.  Well, heavy smoker that he was, his father passed.  And his mother vowed to be the only caretaker that her son would ever need.  Well, healthy as she was, she was bed-ridden by a stroke and she passed on as well.

 

For the next 40 years, Lito was kicked between his sisters’ homes.  He’d care for their yards, watch their kids, help with the chores… but what really occupied his time was music.  He had a penchant for Fleetwood Mac and Steelers Wheel.  When he played downtown, he didn’t play for cash.  He played for the people.  Just know that when he was hitting every chord, he thought he was playing the same perfect rendition of “Stuck in the Middle With You” that he heard through his Walkman.  He made friends.  There was a man dressed all in blue with a blue turban and a beard dyed blue that Lito brought to his mother’s wake.  He called himself Kenny Loggins and served himself up a mountain of Chinese at the after-service buffet but damn if he wasn’t the nicest guy in the room.  Every month Lito’s family would come down to Pioneer Square and pay his tab at the food trucks that fed him.  Always the same, “He don’t cause no trouble.”

 

When I first met Tito Tambo, I found myself to have gravely misinterpreted what ‘crazy uncle’ meant.  I ended up in a hazing ritual where the entire set up was to just place the new guy in a corner with him.  Dude wouldn’t stop talking.  He talked about the millions he had in multiple accounts.  His military career as a 5-star general.  His airplane that was big enough to live on but all they needed was someone to fly it.  I don’t know why—probably boredom— but I said, “You know, I’m a pilot.”  I was maybe 17 or 18 and the only job I had was at the Dollar Tree.  But for all the past delusions Lito couldn’t remember, he never forgot that I was a pilot.

 

Lito always felt neglected at family parties to me, and I hated that.  I was soon promising to jam with him up in the office.  I pulled a bass off the wall.  We sat in uncomfortable chairs as he slid his headset on.  Guess I’d be following his lead.  “Well I don’t know how I got here tonight—”  Alright, Steelers Wheel it is.  We played together for maybe 20 seconds before he stopped.  “Wait!  Wait!  Wait!  Your bass is out of tune.  Here, give it to me.”  Great, gonna be a pain the ass to—  And then he played ‘Smoke on the Water’ perfectly.  Granted, it might be the first song a bass player learns, but I couldn’t fuckin’ believe it.  And the son of a bitch tuned my bass better than I could, too.  “There.  Okay.  Let’s start again.”  TWANG TWANG TWAND TWANG TWANG TWANG—  He was still better at chess than you, too.

 

Lito fell ill back in March.  Couldn’t swallow his food.  Turned out to be esophageal cancer.  I guess being a lifelong smoker will do that to you.  He didn’t want to go through with radiation therapy, though.  Thought that was the thing that killed his dad.  But once his sisters paid him a couple hundred bucks to go, he was ready to entertain them.  Didn’t believe it would work, of course, but told me as we sat in his hospital room that he was doing it to keep his sisters from nagging him.  Instead, he believed his home remedy would be the cure: he was gonna yank out his molar, focus on dental hygiene, and drink a mixture of peanut oil and rubber.  He tells me this as I look over his head and notice that his emergency contact is listed simply as ‘Kasparov”, the reigning champion of chess in the 80’s.

 

Who knows, maybe Tito Tambo had gotten the chance to try his own methods he’d still be annoying the passer-by’s in Pioneer Square today.  Instead, he passed August 29^(th) at the age of 64.  We buried him yesterday.",94,Portland

1nj0k3c,Need to rehome my cat (NE Portland),44,1758074294.0,"Hi, Portland,

We need to rehome my cat Lucy, who is not getting along with my roommate's dog and is experiencing stress.  Here's my write-up for Adopt-A-Pet:

Lucy is a healthy Female 3 year old, black/ white long haired, indoor/outdoor cat.

She is cute and cuddly and loves to curl up on the bed next to your leg or between yourself and your laptop.  She is a sweetheart and will be dearly missed.  She is intelligent, good with doors and rather quiet.

She also likes her YouTube cat TV.

For her best life, she needs a single pet home or a home with another cat (but no dogs). Due to some experiences in her first year (in her first home before ours), she does not get along well with dogs and is nervous around children under age 10.  She has otherwise done well with the other cat in our home.

She is spayed and is under the care of Hannah Pet Society in NE Portland.  You may assume our monthly dues ($79/month for any and all vet care) if you wish.

We will send her with bags of food, her feeder, carrier, litter box and toys, all of which will help her to acclimate to her new home.

1ni5kqj,Paranormal Lloyd center,91,1757989735.0,"Since the Halloween season is upon us, I’ve been bringing this story up more and am curious if anyone working at the Lloyd center has ever experienced something similar.
Back when Spencer’s was still at the Lloyd center I worked there for a couple months before it closed and had some real freaky things go on that weren’t explainable. The biggest is what I call the White Windbreaker guy. 
I was alone in the store for a bit while my manager was in the back and I saw a guy in a white windbreaker with his hood up walk around a corner. I could hear his windbreaker too and I didn’t see him walk in so I went to greet him. I turned the corner maybe a few seconds after him and he was completely gone. I checked the hallway outside the store and didn’t see him anywhere. Few days later I’m asking my coworker there if they had seen anything, and they say they once saw a guy in a white windbreaker walk around a corner in the store and then vanish. That freaked me out but then things escalated. 
A couple weeks later we’re closing the store then what sounds like loud hammering shoot’s up and down the wall connecting us to an empty storefront. It shook the whole wall. I check the store next to us to see if anyone’s working in there and the lights are off and completely empty. Freaked me the fuck out. 
I haven’t really been able to ask anyone working there if they’ve had any similar experiences to that while at the Lloyd center so, if you’ve ever had any paranormal activity happen to you at the Lloyd center I’d love to hear it!!! The white windbreaker guy still freaks me out!",29,Portland

Sweet, healthy malamute waiting at MCAS since June",675,1757986471.0,"Coco is a sweet, beautiful 12 year old malamute who has been waiting at Multnomah County Animal Shelter (MCAS) since June, more than three months without a family. No senior dog should have to stay in the shelter this long!!!

[Link to Coco's Adoption Page](https://www.multcopets.org/adoptable/358684)

Coco came in as a stray with his sister, who had been with him his entire life. Sadly, when their owner was contacted, they said they no longer wanted them. His sister was quickly adopted, but Coco was left behind. Losing both his home and his companion broke his heart. He stopped eating, cried and howled all night, and lost over 10 pounds.

I fostered him for 3.5 weeks this summer and he was the most wonderful companion. He loves lounging in the yard, checking on his people, going for short walks, and even gets the cutest zoomies. He is potty trained, has great recall (fellow dog owners know how important this is!!!), is calm in the house, and bonds deeply with his humans.

Importantly, Coco is also in excellent health for his age! He has great mobility and still has lots of playful energy. Honestly, if I did not know his age, I would never guess it.

The best part is that Coco is a very chill dog. He is not high-energy or demanding, so he is perfect for someone who wants a sweet, steady companion without needing to run around all day. He loves his daily walk, then is happy to relax and soak up love. His mellow nature, cute malamute howl, and older gentleman personality make him an absolute treasure. He’s even a great brew dog!! I took him to a couple breweries where he settled easily and happily soaked up attention from anyone who came to say hi.

Last month, MCAS even featured Coco on their site after a generous community member donated a grooming session for him. You can see the sweet write-up and an adorable video of his bath here: [https://www.multcopets.org/news/round-apaws-dawb-rub-dub-dog-wash-gives-coco-glow](https://www.multcopets.org/news/round-apaws-dawb-rub-dub-dog-wash-gives-coco-glow)

Coco deserves the best home after everything he has been through. If you are looking for a loyal, goofy, loving senior with so much personality, please consider adopting him from MCAS, located at 1700 W Historic Columbia River Hwy, Troutdale, OR 97060

I also left a message for feral cat coalition - but they are closed until tomorrow. At the very least think they need antibiotics (the wound on their chest is very red and probably infected).

Well, I’d love to try to expand my artistic reach by trying out some designs for other neighborhoods as well.  However, given I don’t live in other neighborhoods I’m not as in-the-know about them.

I’d love some of your knowledge about the neighborhoods YOU live in.  I’m looking for “not the main thing”. For example most people, know Paul Bunyan from Kenton, but the Dancin Bare strip club sign was equally iconic and more of a locals-only reference. Similarly, as much as I love the St John’s, what else is well known in St John’s that’s not the bridge?  I’d love to know more about some of yours.

I’m open to all Portland neighborhoods but there are a few I’d really like: St John’s, Overlook, Montavilla, Hollywood, Cully. Open to any others as well.  Thank you!",47,Portland

But I may have overreacted.,630,1757773780.0,"I grew up in places where stores had bulletproof glass and supermarkets had people stopping you from exiting without signing off on your receipt. You know, they often wear a vest (sometimes they're third-party security while other times, they're hourly workers). Where I grew up, they were aggressive towards people who meet a certain profile - and let's just say that profile is people who look like me.

So when I discovered more places in Portland were implementing a ""Receipt Checker"", I rightfully got frustrated. I don't want to be treated like a criminal. And I was seeing them everywhere. Fred Meyers, Ross, even a thrift store.

After a full year, I'd say these receipt checkers are alright. Many times, it's been really pleasant. One guy showed me his marker collection. One made a funny comment about my donuts. One really tough-looking gal drew cat faces on my reciept.

I still think they shouldn't exist. And maybe the stores wish they didn't either.  And maybe people on the Pacific Northwest don't have rent-a-cop energy with sticks up their butts, compared to where I used to live.

I may have overreacted to the Receipt Checkers out there. Thanks for making it a tolerable experience.",518,Portland

1nftqun,holocene portland why you do this to me,0,1757757972.0,"I went to Holocene tonight. The music was great but what broke me was this one girl.

She looked like she walked straight out of a movie, 500 Days of Summer type of scene. We danced near each other for a while, not caring about anyone else. She danced without trying, just being herself, light but not too light. Beautiful in a way that words don’t reach.

For a moment the world felt unreal. And then I remembered I’ll never have her. I’m not from here. I’m leaving soon, back to the other side of the world, Asia, my country. She made me lose hope in the rest of my life because I know I’ll never meet her again.

She wore a flower dress tonight. And I’m just a sensitive artist from the so-called third world. All I want is for this message to somehow reach her, to let her know how much I wanted her. If it were possible I wouldn’t go back. If it were possible I’d even ask her to marry me.

I know this sounds absurd. Maybe it is. But I had to write it down.

And yeah, I know this is a long shot. But hey, nobody here knows who I am, and she probably doesn’t even remember my face. Life already feels absurd because of her. What do I have left to lose lol.

Looking for a furry friend? Cedar and Lilac the kittens are taking adoption applications!

 Cedar is a friendly, playful, beautiful black, 10-week-old kitten. He loves looking out the window, scratches behind his head, and playing with feather toys. He would do well in a home with other cats, potentially dogs if slowly introduced, and older kids or younger pet knowledgeable kids or no children and indoor ONLY. He is especially interested in your application as he's gotten no interest yet :( 

Lilac is a shy and loving 10-week-old kitten. She purrs as soon as you pet her! She would do well in a home with other cats, very calm dogs in slowly introduced, and no / older children, indoor ONLY. She is slow to warm up and needs someone patient and compassionate to let her true colors show. 

The kittens were found lethargic and flea ridden. We were able to get them to the vet and get rid of the fleas and get them used to humans. They have made so much progress and are ready to find their furever home. 

To apply, please comment below or message me so we can give you the application link and answer any questions.

1neimrh,TIL: Portland Police Can Refer A Case To Restorative Justice Services Instead of Arresting Someone,62,1757620124.0,"Just learned that in Portland we have something called the Portland Community Justice Partnership. In short this is a relatively new program where the police can refer cases to a nonprofit who provides restorative justice services instead of arresting someone. The police are supposed to offer this option to people when they arrive on a scene but it sounds like they often aren't. However, anyone involved in a crime can ask for it, whether they're the perpetrator or the victim. If you're a crime victim you can even ask for it when you call the police to report what happened.

It's not available for certain very serious crimes like murder, rape, domestic violence, etc. But it sounds like they've had some good success so far with things like theft, hit and runs, and the like.

Both parties (perp and victim) have to agree to go this route before the case will be handed off to the nonprofit. If the person who committed the crime actively participates in the restorative justice process including effectively repairing with the victim they won't be arrested and won't have charges filed against them. But if they agree to participate and refuse to meaningfully engage, the case goes back to the police AND the DA has agreed to pursue charges against folks who get booted from the program.

Just wanted to spread the word about this because I had never heard of it and I think most other people haven't either! This post is pretty much all I know about it but you can check out their website [HERE](https://lcsnw.org/program/portland-community-justice/) or send any questions to rj@lcsnw.org or 971-888-7829. There are also volunteer opportunities available if anyone's interested, and they also offer non-crime related restorative justice services for a fee (sounds like this could be good for things like neighbor disputes over parking or a barking dog or something if both parties are willing to participate). But mostly, if you find yourself involved in a not super serious crime, be aware that you can ask for this!",18,Portland

1nega9u,Tabor Dance is a peace rally,1228,1757614711.0,"Mother Teresa said, ""I will never attend an anti-war rally; if you have a peace rally, invite me.""

Tabor Dance is a peace rally. It's where strangers can come together to share goodwill, positive energy, and joyful community. It's the world these locals want to live in, the world they promote with their presence.

The event looks like the scene at the end of The Grinch, where the town might be afflicted, yet the people came together in song and celebration. 

There are forces in this world that would like to see us divided, that thrive in making neighbors turn against each other. Our city needs peace rallies now more than ever. Tabor Dance is a frame of reference for what the world could be!

I know that stopping for pedestrians mid-block (not at a crosswalk) is fairly common here and not elsewhere (I learned this when I tried to stop for a pedestrian in another state and they seemed genuinely annoyed at me!) The other one I'm amused by is the polite and unspoken agreement to pull to the side to let another car pass first when there are cars parked on both sides (thus turning a two lane street into a tight fit). Obviously this is in our self interest - no one wants to damage their own or another's vehicle-but I can't imagine drivers in, say, Boston or Philly taking the time to self monitor the traffic flow. Are we just babies about tight spaces? Is this common road etiquette elsewhere and I just need to get out more? Just curious! ",384,Portland

1nd59q7,Reward: Lost Stuffed Bear (Update 1),37,1757480161.0,"Hello everyone, thank you for the incredibly kind outpouring following my post the other night. It has been a silver lining in an otherwise tough few days.

Unfortunately the bear has still not been found, and my partner is taking it very hard. She has not been eating or sleeping much the last few days, even crying so much she has begun to feel ill. The nice comments have been the only thing to make her smile so thank you again.

As for the hotel, it has continued to be very frustrating. As I wrote in a comment on one of the posts, I called the hotel yesterday where an employee told me that they knew where the bear was but I had to wait to hear from the housekeeping manager. I then called again where a second employee told me that they had found two bears in the room but had to wait several more hours to talk to the housekeeping manager who told me that they had not found any bears but that she was going to eventually send in someone to take the bed apart and look around.

I did not receive a call today, and when I called the housekeeping manager she did not call back. I called the hotel itself, only to be told that I can no longer talk to them and must go through the housekeeping manager.

I did email the corporate support line a few days ago, the response I got was they would basically tear the room apart to look for the bear, but they did not provide a timeline of when that would happen and I have not heard back.

It feels silly being so impacted by something like this with everything going on in the world, but this has really knocked us for a loop. My partner is truly devastated and I have spent multiple days with a pit in my stomach. All of this is made worse by the very real indifference we have felt from the hotel staff.

Once again, thank you for the kind words. I know many of you have said you don’t want/need the reward, but my partner and I are desperate and are upping it to $1000 in the hopes that does something.

As a bit of a numismatist, I’ve been scouring the PLANET for these bills for the past ten years. Recently went to visit an old friend and popped into a coin shop and saw a bunch of literature about DB Cooper. 

I came back the next morning and had a really good conversation with the guy that owned the place and told him that I’d looked in auctions—I had had Google notifications on in case anyone ever saw one of these bills or a photo even hit the internet. I just wanted to see one in person!

He’s like, I have all of them….

He’s asked me not to share location but he priced them out for me. I’m trying to repatriate at least one to the PNW. 

The only ones he doesn’t own are owned by the kid that found them—I believe he kept five and may have auctioned them off later. 

I got to take a photo with the three most complete bills. The cheapest is 5K and only a single round seal from one of the dilapidated bills without even a serial.

We are leaving this info here hoping that someone from the area can do something. It looks like the bird will be there in the weekend as the guy is always there.

Previous update: We wrote a message to the Bird Alliance of Oregon and they replied saying they don't have the resources and to call the Oregon Dept of Fish and WIldlife at 503 621 3488 or the Multnomah County Animal Services 503 988 7387.

We only have a data plan on our tourist e-sim and can't make phone calls to call some animal protection number.

We explained we want to let some bird or animal protection know but can't make phone calls and they didn't offer to help in any way and just said ""do what you have to do"" and went away.

1nbvpg6,"So I'm at New Seasons yesterday, and...",999,1757356095.0,"Yesterday, I took the kiddo out to run some weekend errands.  We washed the car and got lunch, and needed to hit the grocery store for some dinner supplies and to drop off some green bags.  I dropped into the New Seasons on NE Broadway or Weidler or whatever the road is up there by the Freddy's.  We buy our food and then head down the ramp to drop off our recycling.

As I'm pulling up, I see the door is open and there's a dude reaching inside.  My first thought is this guy is trying to steal someone's cans but he's wearing like Hokas and like Brooks Brothers khaki shorts or something so I quickly dismiss that notion.  But still, I can hear cans and bottles rattling around.  I park and let the little guy out of the car seat, and open the trunk to get my bags, and by the time I'm ready to take em over the guy is like IN the bottle drop.  All I see now is one foot kinda wiggling against the door like he was getting swallowed up by a time warp or a big whale or something.  The kiddo is like ""Ummmm, daddy?"" and I'm also like ""Uhhhh..."" and then the foot disappears and the door slams shut.  ""Brooks"" has been eaten by the bottle drop and I'm really not sure how to proceed.

So, after some quick reflection I decided the dude probably needs help and also I'm way too curious at this point to take the bottles somewhere else.  Plus, the kiddo is out of the car seat and getting him back in is a whole thing so I'm like ""OK, let's see where this goes.""  I scan my card and open the door and there's this dude just standing in there.  I say ""Hi there.  Um, what's up?"" or some dumb thing like that and he tells me he was trying to get a sticker on a bag he'd just tossed in but now he's stuck and the door in there is locked from the outside (for obvious reasons, I think).  I tell him, ""OK, I'll head into the store and get someone to come down to help"".

The kiddo and I walk up the ramp and he's like PUMPED.  Neither of us have ever seen anything like this and we both think it's pretty funny but also super weird, like honestly WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.  We go inside and I find the person working the self-checkout and tell them what's up.  I'm like ""so, I just saw a dude get swallowed up by the bottle drop downstairs"" and they look at me and they're like ""....coooooool...""  I tell them they look ""normal"", like, aside from the fact that they're inside the bottle drop deposit and locked in, but not like, you know, ""weird"".  And they're like ""...coooooool..."" again but then they're like ""OK, let me try to figure out who to talk to to go help out."".

So me and the buddy go downstairs again and back around to the bottle drop because obviously we need to see where this goes and also I still want to drop these bags off but probably not when there's some dude trapped in there or it's a vortex or something.  We get to the spot and an employee in an apron comes out the regular door - you know, the door authorized people are supposed to use to go in and out of the bottle drop - and he shrugs at me and says ""there's nobody in there.""

And I'm thinking WHAT.  I tell him ""OK, but I totally saw a dude crawl in through the door and get swallowed up in there and the employee is like ""oh, I know, I know, I watched him do it!  we all did."" and he points to a camera on the ceiling inside the door.  Then he proceeds to check inside the big blue bins in there, like the ones you'd drag out to the street that would definitely be big enough to hide a full grown person in.  He opens them both slowly like its a jack-in-the-box.  

THEY'RE BOTH EMPTY.  

The man has disappeared.

I have just returned from a vacation around the Pacific Northwest. This past Thursday, 9/4, my girlfriend and I stayed at the Kimpton Vintage Portland room 606. We were in a rush in the morning and unfortunately lost her stuffed bear, a substantially sentimental item from her grandmother. She has been beside herself with panic attacks and frankly, the hotel has not been the most responsive, consistently only looking at a webpage to see if the bear has been “logged.” 

We are certain the bear is either behind/under the bed or in the laundry. We are offering a $750 reward (in addition to expedited shipping) for the return of the bear. Please… help us.

When they were weaned we took them in and got them fixed and vaccinated through feral cat coalition last week. We have two cats already so would love to find them some new homes. They are all still a little nervous with humans so would need a new owner with the patience to keep working on socializing but we’ve seen them grow so much already and are confident they will one day be great companions. I can get most of them to purr while being pet and two will allow being held and getting pet in my lap. Please reach out to me if interested and we can set up a time to meet them.

There is one female grey tabby, two brown tabbies one male and female and one black female. It would be awesome if anyone wanted to take two as kittens often do better together. All have been fixed and vaccinated, but were too young for rabies vaccine. We think they are about 12 weeks. They all have a little clip in their ear that’s not visible in photos from when fcc did the procedure. It’s hardly noticeable but happy to send updated pics. I live in east Portland area. 

I have an appointment yo give them to pixie project at the start of next month if I don’t find them homes between now and then. And if the two more skiddish ones don’t socialize more and meet their criteria they will go to the humane society and hopefully become barn cats.

These roads and the roads they feed are fully capable of handling 2 lanes of traffic,  in fact it moved traffic more efficiently,  now I’m waiting through 3 and 4 traffic signal cycles just to move 1/4 mile

Now each light cycle only permits 4-5 cars to cross 82nd at a time, that road feeds I205!  Wtf would they restrict outflow to a highway?!

Due to the paw-sitive (haha) response from the last dog I highlighted, I want to do another.

Yesterday, my husband and I went and looked at [Reggie](https://www.petfinder.com/dog/reggie-mcas-77633110/or/troutdale/multnomah-county-animal-services-or57/). He is an 80lb bundle of love! We took him out in the yard to play with him, and the person showing him to us said he's being overlooked due to skin allergies. He is the happiest boy with a goofy personality! They said he was found as a stray, but seemed to be well socialized around people and other dogs. He will need medicated baths regularly and possibly a special diet to help with his skin, but otherwise he would make a perfect dog for a family!

Again, I do not work at or volunteer at this shelter. I am just trying to help dogs get adopted :)

Until now a friend and I have been taking care of him, but the issue is we both have other pets that are the one-dog-per-house type, and it is seeming like Buddy may lean that way too. 

He’s had a really rough life, but he’s such a good boy. He has settled down a lot and gotten more used to living the good life. He needs someone who wants only one dog, is patient, willing to work on training, and has a lifestyle that fits with his high energy and brute strength. 

Ideally someone that can bring him along to work or wfh, and someone active themselves who takes him adventuring with them. 

He’s good at dog parks, too much for cats, very loyal, very attentive, and very snuggly. 

All rescue places are filled to the brim so now I am left wondering…can the magic of Reddit help me find Buddy’s soul mate? In another world, where I didn’t already have a zoo, I would absolutely keep him myself. He is such a joy to be around.

I've been unsuccessful in finding him a new home and it's starting to take a toll on everyone in the home-him, my cat, and myself. The situation is becoming more dire and I'm looking to rehome him as soon as possible.
We're on the waiting list for the Humane Society, but the wait could still be another couple of months. It breaks my heart to see how this living situation is impacting both of them and it's kicking my mental health's ass.
Thanks for reading.

I'll paste the original post's text below:

“Last Christmas I brought home a rabbit for my roommate and I. We were like platonic dads to this little guy and we both love him dearly.

He and I had to part ways from our living situation (a slumlord slapping bandaids on gaping wounds, we couldn’t stay any longer) and we both had to downsize—him to a studio, me to a one bedroom with myself, my rabbit, and a cat.

Our rabbit went from having his own bedroom, a whole upstairs floor of a house, and a backyard to a large cage with limited time to free roam. I work too much and don’t feel comfortable leaving him out alone with our cat (as docile, old, and chonk as he may be).

Ultimately it’s become apparent that my sweet boy’s quality of life has taken a hit and he deserves much better. I’m stressed out knowing that I’m unable to provide him with the care, space, and attention he needs.

I’m looking to rehome him with someone who has more space and either the time or people around to pay him as much attention as he needs. Ideally someone with a yard, but if not then plenty of space to roam. He comes with a large cage (if you’d like), a litter box, potty pads, some bedding, a big bag of hay, and tons of pellets/additives and treats. I can provide nail clippers as well. I’d prefer that someone with experience with caring for small animals takes him, but if not that’s okay too—I can provide you with as much information as possible.

He’s just over a year old and has not yet been neutered. It was first on the list of priorities once my finances recover from the move, but I’ve been in the new place for less than a month and I’m unfortunately not there yet. Other than that he’s perfectly healthy and full of love and life.

Please go easy on me—this isn’t what I wanted by any means. My cat and I have both bonded with him, he’s my boy. I just want to see that he goes to the right home. Having to rehome him is devastating and whoever gets this wild little spirit is lucky.”",18,Portland

1n7zs9n,Mr. Blue needs a home. Let it be yours!,253,1756957203.0,"Meet Mr. Blue. He's an extremely sweet gray cat who absolutely loves attention. He previously lived in a 300 sqft home (room, really) with 2 other cats, which caused him immense stress to the point where he was urinating outside of the litter box.

Mr. Blue was dropped off voluntarily at a vet for euthanization due to his 'inappropriate urination'. The owner dropped him off, told the vet the situation, then left.

I found out about this quickly and called the vet to arrange to take him in instead of letting him die. The vet tech I talked to told me that she was going to take him in, monitor his habits, then set him up for adoption.

She's had him for a few weeks, and Mr. Blue has not peed outside of his litter box at all. We both think that the previous living situation (300sqft, multiple cats, etc) was stressing him out to the breaking point. Taking him out of that situation seems to have completely remedied that.

We think he's absolutely ready to live in a healthy environment as an only cat.

Mr. Blue is neutered. He's extremely sweet, is very playful, and loves getting attention. I would take him in myself, but I already have multiple cats and as I said before, he would most likely thrive in a situation as an only cat.

One last important note: Mr. Blue has had a urinary blockage in the past. He had to have surgery to correct it. He's fine now, but in order to prevent future urinary blockages, the vet recommends putting him on a urinary diet from now on. 

Please help me find Mr. Blue a new home!",18,Portland

The west side is better than the east side. Here’s why. Gullies, tall trees, and windy quiet streets through SW and the NW hills. Still pretty well served by transit considering how residential most of the west side is. The south waterfront is gorgeous to look at from afar or explore, and Terwilliger is one of the most beautiful places in the city to walk, run, or bike. The trails leading up toward OHSU and up to Fairmount Drive are wonderful as well. You have incredibly easy access to downtown from all of SW via Barbur, and from most of NW via Burnside/Skyline. Performing arts, shopping and dining, and a massive public university downtown. Gorgeous views back to downtown from both the West Hills and Kings Heights. Top notch neighborhood corridors like Multnomah Village, NW 23rd, and the Pearl. Amazing access to the river at Willamette park and several houseboat communities. Tryon Creek State Park. Two highly rated public high schools and many well regarded elementary and middle schools. While it may be easy to say that these are all things that require some degree of wealth to enjoy, the east side (west of ~50th) is comparably expensive to live in. The east side certainly has lots of desirable commercial strips, but who needs that many? The west side has a manageable amount of quality businesses. Also, it has a surprising amount of diversity if you know where to look (but unfortunately admittedly less than the east side). I love all of Portland. But the west side is the best side.

Public art projects are powerful ways to encourage community investment.

Some quotes from the painting neighbors:

""Project-based action is how we get to know each other a little bit more than just saying Hi.""

""You get to break barriers to connecting with people from so many different backgrounds. This is proof that we can work together, and this does not have to be an isolated event.""

""It's a rare moment of community in the current age.""

**MY RECENT THOUGHTS ON MAXIMIZING IMPACT:**

\---> ***TOH MUST BE REMOVED SAFELY & WITH PROPER TECHNIQUE.***

* Folks are unclear on PPE, herbicide types, and technique, and can easily hurt themselves, others, or the natural environment, especially using Triclopyr. Glyphosate is safer for several reasons, go read all about it... TLDR: use only [this](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/compare-n-save-concentrate-grass-and-weed-killer-41-glyphosate-1118710) & read the label (!!!), wear long sleeves, pants, closed-toe footwear, latex gloves, and apply the minimum amount necessary in late summer/early fall (now!).
* Chopping down TOH makes it grow back stronger. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKLW2TXS1jg) is a good intro (Penn State U Extension)

**1- Nonviolent and extremely boring**

And more importantly 

**2- Unusable for propaganda**

The first has been discussed ad nasueam so we don't need to keep going over it in this thread.

But for B, it is critical that everyone, and I mean EVERYONE keep the messaging simple:

""Trump knew Epstein, Trump diddles children, Release the files""

Pictures of Trump + Epstein, Pictures of Trump's signature on the birthday cards, etc.

Business owners put the pictures of Epstein and Trump on your storefronts/signage/billboards. 

Trump wants to occupy your city with the military, counter this by occupying your city with what he *really* doesn't want, more focus on the fact he is a pedophile.

----

Another important factor in this, don't dress in black and red and look like the pictures they are displaying on Fox News.

Wear regular, boring, mundane clothing that will make all the video they get uninteresting and relatable to anyone across the US. Their goal is to rile up their base and further the divide, related to the rest of the US.

And I hate to say this, but don't be weird, be boring until they go away. The troops are not your enemy either here, treat them well, shit treat them better than they are getting treated by their bosses. Bring them water bottles, take fun pictures with them (bonus points for holding up pics of Epstein), and generally welcome them.

1ns8pdv,Repost of Inspiring Text from /r/portland in 2020 - Wish I knew what user to credit them,0,1759013437.0,"Portland is nestled between two rivers, spilling out from the confluence of the Columbia and the Willamette (rhymes with ‘dammit‘) at the northernmost reach of a fertile valley, eighty miles from the Pacific and eighty miles from Mt. Hood, bounded by low hills and farmland, circled by freeways, thirty feet about sea level, dressed in mist and rain and roses, suffused with pine trees and hazels, cedars, maples and oaks, buckled over by bridges, built on the land of the Chinook peoples, the Multnomah and the Clackamas and the Cowlitz tribes.  It was named by two coin flips; had chance gone the other way, I’d be writing an essay about Boston, Oregon.  It was called Stumptown because during its first explosive growth the trees were leveled for lumber and for space, and people hopped from stump to stump to avoid the muck of the nascent roads.  It’s called Bridgetown, the spans over the Willamette throbbing with cars, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, a list Homeric, from the Sellwood and Ross Island at the south end of the city through the Tillikum Crossing, the Marquam, the Hawthorne and Morrison and Burnside, the Steel and Broadway trusses, the high arches of the Fremont, then the Burlington Northern railway bridge and the St. Johns suspension.  We are the City of Roses.  We are Rip City.  We are stuffed full of bookstores, dotted with marijuana dispensaries, a city replete with strip clubs, microbrews and coffee mingling in our bloodstream, a city where the Trail Blazers play, and the Thorns and Timbers, but also where there’s a thriving roller derby league, adult kickball competitions, axe-throwing and cornhole and a soapbox derby combining engineering and alcoholism, careening down the slopes of a volcano every summer in a hop-scented haze.

Portland’s history is colorful, filled with mobsters and whores, gambling and press-ganging, bordellos floating on houseboats on the Willamette, smuggling tunnels under the downtown streets, barroom ghosts and train robbers.  

But Portland’s history is also a history of white supremacy and racism, of intolerance, bigotry and slaughter.  In 1940 Oregon--the whole STATE of Oregon--had fewer than 1,800 Black people in it.  And then during the war Portland’s shipyards fired up, and Blacks came to town to build weapons.  By 1946 there were 15,000 Black people in Portland, most of them concentrated in one area, a place known as Vanport, located at an elevation about fifteen feet below the Columbia River.  After the war, the mayor of Portland said in a newspaper article that, frankly, Blacks were no longer welcome.  And then, in 1948, on Memorial Day, during a period of heavy, sustained rain, a berm broke.  Vanport flooded.  Those Blacks who had come to Portland, probably the whitest city in America, lost their homes and livelihoods.  It wasn’t until 1959 that Oregon ratified the 15th Amendment, giving Blacks the right to vote.  In 1981--when I was twelve--a couple of Portland cops tossed four dead possums onto the entryway of a Black-owned hamburger joint.  In 1988--the year after I graduated high school, in a class with exactly zero African-American students--an Ethiopian student here in Portland named Mulugeta Seraw was beaten to death, by white supremacists, with a baseball bat ‘because (as one of the murderers said) of his race’.  We’ve had Klan mayors, and Klan police chiefs, and Klan businessmen.



Portland is beautiful.  I choke up sometimes, crossing the Ross Island Bridge as the sun sets over the West Hills, at how beautiful the city is, limned in evening radiance and bespeckled with the lights in the downtown windows, the slow peaceful parade of cars, the twinkle of the radio towers.  But I never, ever forget that the foundations of the Rose City are built on concrete concocted with innocent blood.  And when the Proud Boys and the boogaloo assholes and the trump brownshirts come rumbling into town in their four-bys, togged out in camo and hefting military-grade armaments in the beds, firing paintballs and pepper spray at protestors while the cops take a powder and a long smoke break, it doesn’t surprise me.  In Portland, it was ever thus.

But for all of that--Portland also has another nickname.  It was given to us by the Secret Service under George H.W. Bush, who really, really hated it whenever they had to come here to provide security for him or Vice President Quayle.  Racist and exclusionary as Portland’s history has been, we’re also the home of Reed College, one of the most liberal activist hotbeds in the country.  For all our dearth of Black people, we can gin up a BLM protest with a thousand participants at the drop of a hat.  Occupy Wall Street was huge, here.  Our Pride parades are amazing.  The city may be a house built by racists, with the bones of dead minorities, but living in that house are humans who want to tear all that shit down and build a BETTER home, a home rising from the bedrock of equality and justice and compassion, humans who wake up every morning and whose first thoughts are of destroying the patriarchy, the oligarchy, the creaking lumbering capitalistic automaton that seeks to keep us all low, ignorant, poor, and enslaved.  And Portland protests.

BOY does Portland protest.

That’s why the Bush people called us ‘Little Beirut’.  They’d fly here with Dan Quayle to have a thousand-dollar-a-plate lunch with the Republican Businessmen’s Coalition at the Multnomah Athletic Club, and there’d be five hundred psychos in tie-dyed shirts thronging the street outside, playing Neil Young’s ‘Ohio’ and Buffalo Springfield‘s ‘For What It‘s Worth‘, smoking pot and chanting.  Once a group of protestors chugged a bunch of food-colored liquid, then lined up in front of the Vice President’s hotel and, on cue, puked out huge vomitous puddles of red, white and blue onto the pavement.  Currently, we’ve got protestors with lacrosse rackets catching tear gas canisters and lobbing them back at the cops, we’ve got dads with leaf blowers clearing the air, and hippies with bundles of burning sage sweetening it.  We had a Wall of Moms, we had the naked yoga Athena, we’ve got volunteers feeding the masses, impromptu ambulances and medics dealing with burning eyes and rubber-bullet contusions, and we have, all over the city, Black Lives Matter signs on telephone poles, children playing while their parents sit on lawn chairs next to busy thoroughfares holding up Breonna Taylor placards, we have movie theater marquees with ACAB across them, and restaurants and boutiques with solidarity messages in the windows.

“Tin soldiers and Nixon coming” sang Neil Young.  Now the tin soldiers are federal troops in camouflage, without name tags or identifying marks, and Nixon has been replaced by trump, but the threat is the same, and the stakes higher.

Portland isn’t perfect.  But, for what’s happening now, in this country, at this time, when every Democratic principle has been laid down on the table waiting for the roll of the dice, we may be the best hope America has.  We have our Klan, our Proud Boys, our white supremacists and racists and xenophobes and capitalists--but we also have a hard, steel core of true patriots willing to stand, to fight, and to die for justice.

trump wants to make an example of Portland.  We are his Carthage.  He wants to ride in here, tear the city down to its bedrock, then seed the ground with salt.  We are going to be his Reichstag fire, his USS Maine, his casus belli, his Sudetenland.

And he may win.  I don’t know what the future holds.  But I do know this city, this frustrating, marvelous, horrible, magical city.  And I know this as well--trump better bring a fucking lunch.

Maybe everybody here can follow suit.  The Klingons occupied the Organian planet and they ignored them.  Kirk tried to organize a resistance but nobody wanted to help.  They didn’t need to fight back because they were highly evolved beings.

It is with heavy heart I find news of your ongoing war. Cocking my ear, I do believe I hear the faint ringing of mortar shells...yes, indeed I do. They ring out like the pangs of my heart, knowing each explosion may well be the final cry of a life.

Lest you grow weary, digging into the trenches; battening down the hatches; visiting Whole Foods; know that the rest of us Yankees have now heard the news. Take strength in the knowledge that reinforcements will soon arrive! Poppy - my 6 month old French Bulldog - knows that what was once a vacation has now turned into a war campaign. Her poison gas...truly rotten, lung melting gas...will be a gruesome but welcome ally on the fields of battle.

Though the rivers may run red with blood as screams sound out in a cacophony of death, though the bombs and tanks may rumble the very Earth. Hold! Hold, for the Orange Fuhrer has seen your cause and will save you!

I caught a show at the Hollywood theatre and enjoyed some dumplings at Hawthorne Asylum. Even though it rained the whole time I had an awesome experience. 

I think my point is that Portland is a truly fascinating city filled with great people and culture (and coffee). I would love to return one day (feel free to drop recommendations for my next visit).

I can envision pushback from some about my idea and discuss it later in the post. But I do think my idea has a place. 

The French resistance during WWII used similar tactics to confuse their opponents and influence public perception about the realities of the war. 

My idea would include white women cosplaying very much in the trad-wife aesthetic portraying Portland as a 1950s MAGA Christian dreamland. 

(Cute pastel dresses, curled hair, Fox News make up, collecting flowers, browsing markets, and tearfully crying out about occupation by troops and how scary it is—questioning why they are here when it’s such a peaceful place. (It IS a peaceful place, this is not a lie.) 

I can even imaging a freedom-of-religion narrative, how we’ve been able to express our Christian values here free of persecution .  (I am in fact atheist).

I’d work with a few psychologists to come up with natural scripts that cause dissonance that targets the MAGA own-the-lib and destroy-sanctuary-cities thinking. And we can flood Facebook, X, truth social, instagram, and tik tok with video content. 

The pushback I can imagine is that this is a classiest or racist response of a privileged white person and that this is not the proper way to fight fascism. 

The thing is, we know that Trump / Miller are trying to escalate things to stir up violence and fulfill their prophecy that Portland IS in fact a war ravaged city. This also protects black and trans people from being identified and lets them rest, stay home! 

If anyone is interested in discussing my vision, please reply and I’ll set up a server to discuss.

Check out all the deets [here](https://portlandultimate.org/e/natty-hatty-6) or by going to [PortlandUltimate.org](http://PortlandUltimate.org) and looking for Natty Hatty under the adult tab.

1nranq9,"Recycle your old tech and browse no to low cost electronics at Free Geek’s Pop-up! Saturday, September 27th from 11AM - 4PM at 1731 SE 10th ave.",64,1758915155.0,"**What is Free Geek?**  
Free Geek is a Portland based non-profit founded on Earth Day, 2000. Our mission is to sustainably reuse technology, enable digital access, and provide education to create a community that empowers people to realize their potential.

Free Geek’s goal is to divert technology that would otherwise be thrown away, refurbish it, and give it back to our community at no or low cost. What cannot be refurbished is recycled in an environmentally responsible manner. Since 2000, we have diverted 27,000,000+ lbs of e-waste from landfills, and granted 75,000+ devices back to the community.

**What technology do you take?**

Free Geek accepts nearly everything that plugs in or uses electricity, including computers, smartphones, tablets, printers, TVs, Audio/video systems, related accessories, and much more. We are also a proud participant of the Oregon E-Cycles program, which guarantees convenient recycling of computers, monitors, TVs, printers, keyboards, and mice for Oregonians and many small businesses.

While we do take most electronics, there are some things we don’t accept: [https://www.freegeek.org/small-donation#what-we-dont-accept](https://www.freegeek.org/small-donation#what-we-dont-accept)

We don’t require a fee for our recycling service, but we do invite donors to consider making an optional monetary donation to support our work toward bridging the digital divide in our community.

**What happened to the Free Geek Thrift Store?**  
Like most small businesses, Free Geek was impacted by the COVID pandemic. This forced us to shut down our brick and mortar thrift store and we have not re-opened since. With regular pop-up shops we hope to re-engage with the community and inch back towards opening our thrift store again.

Free Geek’s online store is still available at: [https://www.ebay.com/str/freegeekportland](https://www.ebay.com/str/freegeekportland) and we offer free local pickup for all orders.

**What is available at the pop-up shop?**  
The pop-up shop will have a selection of low to no cost refurbished computers, phones, and monitors. In addition to vintage tech, retro gaming consoles, and niche accessories that span generations of tech innovation. We also provide free essentials like cables, power banks, power cords, and computer accessories. Every purchase at Free Geek’s pop-up shop supports our mission to bridge the digital divide.

**Can I use my store credit?**  
Yes! If you have store credit from our old thrift store, you can bring it by and we’ll apply the credit to your purchase.

**Can I return items bought at the Free Geek pop-up shop?**  
All sales at the pop-up shop are final. If something is defective or not working, bring it back to our next pop-up shop for an exchange. We do not offer refunds.",4,Portland

1nqlt68,"How do folks feel about ""game changing"" Portland projects, like a MLB stadium and Frog Ferry?",0,1758842413.0,"I'm trying to figure out how I feel about Portland's future and often swing between despair and cautious optimism that things could get better if... \[fill in the blank\]. 

On one hand, I've been seeing more open drug use, often multiple times a day, folks huddled around trash fires next to decrepit RVs, and folks sleeping/passed out on the streets. It felt like things were getting better in late spring, but in the past few weeks, things have felt as bad as I've ever seen. The electric fence around the old Dollar Tree & associated parking lot on Lombard also seems to elevate the dystopian prison vibes as I get word of parents being detained by ICE. 

On the other hand, I've been enjoying the bike lane improvements around North Portland, the TASS sites and shelters appear to be helping people, and some local business owners seem hopeful for the future. I love seeing the Timbers and Thorns stadiums as full as they are, and biking to watch the away games with the community at Chill&Fill fills my heart.  

I'm not on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Nextdoor, etc... so I might be more reliant on conversations with neighbors and the North Peninsula Review to develop my take on things than I should be, and I'm wary of my echo chamber's bias. 

I guess my questions for folks here are:

* How do you feel about Portland's future? 
* What projects or plans make you roll your eyes?
* Which ones make you deeply nervous about your ability or willingness to stay here?
* Which ones give you glimmers of hope that things will get better?
* Is the MLB coming to Portland a pipedream? a scam? The thing that will gentrify Portland, making it even less affordable?
* How much of your feelings about Portland are based on decisions being made at the federal level versus locally driven? 

Appreciating everyone's thoughts on this in advance. Fingers crossed this won't throw me back into the despair swing tonight. ",48,Portland
