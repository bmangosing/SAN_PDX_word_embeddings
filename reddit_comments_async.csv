I think what the mayor is doing is willfully ignoring homelessness research and favoring solutions that he thinks will “clean up the city” and solutions that are as cheap as possible even if they’re not very effective for the homeless population.

Most of his decisions for opening night time only shelters seems to be based on this incorrect assumption that most unhoused people have jobs they can go to during the day. EVEN IF that were true, the night time only shelters don’t even have showers or places to hold your stuff so that seems rather punishing for people who do have day time employment.

I don’t like the notion that someone coming in doing something is better than nothing - because we weren’t doing nothing and this actually seems harmful to both housed and unhoused citizens. For example, I’d be fine living near a 24hr shelter.

1npo1hg,ng12fft,"I don't think comments like this help.

Sure, there are bleeding hearts who do literally think this way, but I genuinely believe they are a small minority. I think a TON of the problem is we're sweeping so many issues under a broad umbrella of homelessness which is ultimately just a descriptor of circumstance around one specific essential need. It's not a descriptor of lifestyle or personhood. 

First, you have to look at situational vs chronically homeless. Most of what we stress about is the chronically homeless, and that group can be categorized many different ways and need to be addressed in many different ways. Some of what we look at and think ""drugs"" is severe mental illness that never involved drugs. Some mental illnesses are extraordinarily hard to treat because the sick person does not have the rational mind to actively participate in their own treatment. Some people are severely mentally ill as a direct result of prolonged substance abuse. Some are a bit of both. 

We need to stop talking about homelessness and start focusing on crime because, really, do any of us give a shit where the fent addict causing havoc lays their head down at night?

Billing periods used:

Quarterly accounts: February 1 – April 30
Bi-monthly accounts: January 1 – April 30
Monthly and budget billing accounts: December 1 – April 30

However there are millions of cats nationwide. And I don't think the vast majority are getting  necropsies. 

I'm sure there are cats that live long lives outdoors. But I can tell you that I have had 6 cats in my life.  One is indoor and alive at nine years of agr. Two were indoor/outdoor and then brought indoors and died of old age.  The three that were indoor/outdoor. One died of feline leukemia, two were ""disappeared"" by coyotes. I know they would have lived longer had they been in doors. 

I would argue that bringing cats indoors mitigates many risks to their health and longevity. Especially in urban environments.",28,1758732321.0

1npe4pf,nfzn7jb,"Ya but people will always downvote you to hell for pointing it out. The fairest take I have for it is it’s like the average lifetime 200 years ago compared to the average lifetime now. Just because it was 40 then doesn’t mean people didn’t regularly live to be 80. The average is skewed because of the infant mortality rate. 

If the stat includes stray cats and their kittens it’s going to bring the average down by a lot. Based on the outdoor cats I see in my neighborhood and on my cameras almost every night their average lifespan is much more than 5 years. ",-4,1758737707.0

These groups were statistically different overall (p = 0.002) with indoor only cats and cats that lived indoor/outdoor being having a lower proportion of infected cats then outdoor only cats (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0006 respectively. There was no difference between cats that lived indoor only and those that lived indoor/outdoor (p = 0.15).

> FeLV positive status was associated with decreased longevity (P<0.0001) while FIV status was not.

> The median age of death for an FeLV positive cat amongst cats of all ages was 3.89 years (IQR 1.64–7.58 years; range 0.22–15.25 years) while the median age of death for an FeLV negative cat was 8.70 years (IQR 4.03–12.17 years; range 0.12–21.85 years).

So, outdoor cats have significantly higher rates of FeLV. FeLV is associated with decreased longevity. And the average lifespan of cats with FeLV is 3.89 vs 8.70 without.

It took five minutes to find this information (CTRL+F ""outdoor""). To be even more pedantic, I downloaded the actual [data for the study](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278199.s004) and did a pivot table looking at just the age vs the environment. Looks like 9.2 vs 7.5. Not as big of a difference people commonly quote, but still a significant one. Indoor cats live an extra 23% longer.

The biggest difference seemed to be neutered/spayed vs intact. Female cats: 9.92 vs 3.59 and male cats: 9.08 vs 2.75.",1,1758755112.0

They call for more jurors than they actually need, and everyone called up will go through a questioning process to determine who gets seated for the trial.

Those who don't get selected to report to a courtroom will continue waiting in the jury lounge. More lotteries will happen if there are more trials that need jurors. Once the jury lounge staff get word that no more jurors are needed for the day, everyone remaining will be sent home and your jury service is done.

It's entirely possible that they don't have any trials to select for that day, or all scheduled cases avoid going to trial at the last minute. When this happens, everyone is dismissed.

1npmpfp,ng0d4s5,I’m not saying what this woman said is right. But everyone who is pro “no kill” needs to volunteer in ANY municipal shelter and see the quality of life for all the animals. I wouldn’t wish a prolonged shelter stay on any animal. It’s not humane to be locked up in a 5x5 concrete box for longer than a month (even that is too long imo).

Our last two pups were/are shelter dogs. The first one was a 9/10 year old Australian terrier who seemed lovely in the shelter and meeting our dog, but we quickly found out once home he was a resource guarder. He definitely caused some stress at first, but we did our due diligence (separating the dogs during meals, putting up bowls once they had finished, putting the guarder down if he was guarding a lap, among other things). I’ve found quite a few people will return a dog when they aren’t the perfect dog they expect from the get. What is a shelter supposed to do with a repeat dog? Take Franklin’s case. Double returned, once after a bite/nip and the second time after being in the home only a few days - not enough time for issues to even begin be sorted out. Not to mention, not everyone tells the truth when returning a dog - some outright lie thinking it will get the dog adopted vs euthanized (and are just passing problem dogs onto someone else). I’ve seen people calling out rescues for adopting out dogs that are known biters, and the adopters only finding out after they were bit. 
It’s an untenable situation. I get her frustration, even if I don’t agree with how she voiced it. Shelters didn’t cause the mess, but now they are responsible for it. People impulsively buy an animal from a bad backyard breeder, and then dump them when they grow bored/need to train/need to move/whatever the reason. Animal ownership isn’t treated how it should be - as a commitment for that animal’s lifetime. For a lot of people, it’s a whim to be thrown away, and the shelters and especially the animals in the shelters are the ones who suffer.",14,1758746758.0

The simple answer to this question is: no. When you are in a public setting such as a concert, grocery store, a park, and many others, recordings are permitted. The primary motivator for recording in these types of atmospheres is to ensure safety and enhanced security. Once you leave your private property, you should not be expecting full privacy.

The people that get so bothered and worked up with people standing in public with their cameras is a bit ridiculous and many times they get educated by public safety that it’s not illegal what they’re doing and they’re in the right. Although it’s a waste of public safety resources, I find the entitlement of the people calling and complaining to public safety about these auditors  to be inappropriate and brought light to me how uninformed people are with some of the most common laws we have in this country. I don’t condone the auditors that deliberately instigate by taunting or bullying but there’s plenty I’ve seen online that do nothing else but to just stand there and record.
