1npqy22,"Found dog downtown unable to locate owner, what can I do?",134,1758755235.0,"My sister was walking to a job site from her office on the corner of Broadway and oak. She saw this dog trotting alone, dragging a leash. She picked up the leash and walked around with it for about 30 minutes looking for an owner with no luck. It looks like it has recently had puppies, is wearing a diaper, has painted claws, and looks malnourished. The humane society requires you to bring the dog to them and she's commuting on her bike today. She doesn't want it to get ran over but also has to go back work. Is there a rescue or a shelter that picks up dogs? Is someone able to pick it up from downtown? She called a vet and they said they could see if there's a chip, but basically said ""it depends on how involved you want to get"". ",31,Portland

1npjbi7,Expect your PDX water bill to be 6.3% higher (and how to help),158,1758737037.0,"I checked but didn't see a previous post about this. Portland Water Bureau raised rates on July 1 (as they do every year).  If you haven't gotten a quarterly bill since then, here's a reminder to expect it to be higher.

The reasons for these rate increases have been covered in previous threads, but are also [described](https://www.portland.gov/water/customer-service/pay-your-utility-bill/what-your-bill-pays) on PWB's website. (TL;DR: Deferred infrastructure and maintenance, and \*gestures broadly at the economy\*)

Ways to mitigate the impact on your wallet from easiest to hardest:

1. Contact PWB & switch to monthly billing. They still only read the meter every 3 months, but they divide that bill up into 3 equal(ish) payments over 3 months.
2. Sign into your account and make sure you're signed up for Clean River Rewards if eligible (even if you signed up for it years ago- they reset the system a year or two ago and we had to re-signup).
3. If you're still paying by card (debit or credit), they started charging the card processing fee a few months ago. Set up a ""bill pay"" from  your online bank account (your bank sends them money), ACH/payment on your PWB account (PWB draws from your bank), ... or start sending checks in the mail with a stamp, whatever floats your boat.
4. **Even if you are a renter**, [get the water free efficiency kit from PWB](https://www.portland.gov/water/water-efficiency-programs). DO NOT SLEEP ON HOW MUCH MONEY (WATER) YOU CAN SAVE BY CHANGING YOUR AERATORS! If you have a 2.5 gallon per minute (gpm) showerhead (standard since 1992), switching to the 1.5 gpm will save you FORTY PERCENT of your shower water use. Even if you only have a 2 gpm (""water sense"" labelled), it will still save you TWENTY FIVE percent. Ditto with kitchen sink aerator. Tenants can easily do these changes, you just need a towel and possibly an adjustable wrench or vise grip if it's really stuck on. (Caveat: a lot of newer sink faucets have either a proprietary ""key"" that you need to get the aerator out, that you can buy the key online; or they require a different kind of aerator, which in many cases you can still get from a big box store online for $4-7.)
5. Hopefully you don't have any leaks, but if you do, fix it with the above free kit and/or call a professional. Then ask PWB for a refund (they will refund some cash for fixed leaks)
6. PWB has info about [deferring bills](https://www.portland.gov/water/customer-service/pay-your-utility-bill/request-payment-arrangement) & [financial assistance](https://www.portland.gov/water/customer-service/apply-financial-assistance) on their page. Eligibility for financial assistances starts at $52,128/year or less gross income for a single person, $67,020 for a family of 3, etc.
7. If you're a homeowner or otherwise fairly settled long term, consider investing $100 or so in a timer and a soaker hose for your summer seasonal garden beds and trees. When you're re/planting any yard areas, consider adding trees to shade plants and reduce their water use (and lower your cooling bill), and natives from the Portland Plant List, which will generally require little or no water if you plant them in areas similar to their usual habitat. (If you have a dry, hot, exposed area, plant plants from section 2.7 and 2.8a ""prairie"" and ""dry rocky outcrops."" If you have a dry shady area under trees, section 2.1 ""western hemlock-douglas fir forest."" Etc.",62,Portland

1np8e28,59 Dogs at the Troutdale Shelter!,182,1758709098.0,"Dear Portlanders, the Multnomah County Animal Shelter has 59(!) dogs right now. That is the most I have ever seen. They are a kill shelter fyi. Anyone looking for a new friend or family member? Or has anyone ever considered fostering for them? Or volunteering to walk dogs?

Oregon Humane Society and Oregon Dog Rescue, for example, have much better systems for volunteering, fostering, and adopting, but these dogs at MCAS are just as deserving and really need us.  
  
Check them out: [MCAS dogs](https://www.multcopets.org/adoptables?adopt%5B0%5D=species%3ADog&page=1)

ETA: since some people prefer to live in their fairytale world, to be considered a “no kill shelter,” a shelter must have a 90% live rate or higher. They have been under 90% for a few years and removed “no kill” from their website. You can check the stats on their website and there is an article I will find about this. Their official euth policy of 3/24 mentions considering kennel capacity, limited options for transfer or foster, available resources, etc

Update: there are now 62!
  
Anyway, here are a few of their sweet faces:

I've been checking online marketplaces like Facebook and eBay with no luck and would be super grateful for any tips or if you happen to see it listed, dumped, or for sale!!

Day 1:  
Flew in from SFO, ended up driving down to Eugene to watch the Emeralds play (big SF Giants fan). Drive there reminded me a lot of the Central Valley back in CA.

Day 2:   
Went to Screen Door for brunch. The shrimp and grits were terrific! Didn't realize how much food it was going to be or I wouldn't have ordered the fried okra but was not mad about it at all. Explored Hawthorne Street afterwards and went thrifting. Didn't find anything I liked (I guess I'm not en vogue) but still loved walking around the neighborhoods. Also extremely appreciate how easy your public transit is! Although I would love a little faster headways. For dinner, I was able to snag a reservation at Langbaan and it was absolutely terrific! Patrick and Molly were lovely and I loved the info on each dish as it was presented.

Day 3:  
Had breakfast at Cheryl's which was probably the weakest of all the meals I had (I know it was controversial on here but decided to try anyways). Just overpriced and meh. But afterwards, I went up to the Rose Test Garden as well as the Japanese Garden and I LOVED both. I found myself coming back to the rose garden a couple times in my explorations on this day and it was an instant mood lifter. Dinner today was at Ox Restaurant which I think was my favorite out of the trip. Forget the gentleman's name who was serving but he was excellent. The tres leches cake for dessert was worth the trip alone! Afterwards, I met up with friends at Scandals(sad that it's closing), and then we went to Silverado and closed at Stag.

1nn20dv,"This is my Portland: Swift Watch, Saturday Night",377,1758484845.0,"Last night I went with a couple of friends to watch the Vaux's swifts fly into the chimney at Abernethy Elementary School, which is where they have relocated after many years in the chimney at Chapman Elementary School. Normally the swifts would overnight in hollow snags (standing dead trees), but with the wholesale destruction of most of our old growth forest--and therefore the big, dead trees they need--they've had to adapt to chimneys instead since the 1980s.

As always, it was a picnic atmosphere, with people of all ages sitting on the lawn to watch the swifts dive into the chimney at dusk. There were kids playing soccer, and some amateur acrobats, and as darkness began to fall someone began tossing a glowing foam Nerf ball around. While we waited for the swifts to arrive, we enjoyed the large numbers of crows winging their way overhead as they went en masse to their favorite roosting spots.

And the swifts! I think we counted a flock of at least 400, and more kept coming. I wasn't keeping a really close count, but it easily could have been twice that number with stragglers by the time all was said and done. The biggest flock murmurated like starlings, and a couple of times a hapless crow got caught up in the traffic, an oversized hanger-on entangled with the smaller swifts. They seemed to take longer to go into the chimney, with a few still struggling to find a spot as it got dark, but that may be because they weren't as used to this chimney, or perhaps the mouth wasn't as amenable to easy landings as the one at Chapman. But they all made it in eventually.

*This* is my Portland. This is why I love it here. There are so many people here whose idea of a good time is to sit on a wide grassy lawn with a picnic and a few friends, watching this crowd of tiny insectivorous birds angle their way into an old chimney, cheering every time some of them funnel their way in for a safe landing. I moved here almost two decades ago, and overwhelmingly this has been my experience here.

1nmrvaa,Smoked Out of My Apartment,22,1758461027.0,"Edit: I have an air purifier. All it does is flash red that the air quality is s*** 

I live in a non-smoking Hud apartment complex, and I've been looking for a place to live due to 2nd hand smoke, but none of the apartments are accessible as I use a power chair or Walker.  My current apartment is not habitable due to the smoke - I am in and out of the ER and urgent care and have recently been giving an inhaler due to the constant secondhand smoke in my apartments .

I talked to an attorney and I have no legal recourse against a permissive landlord who does nothing to smokers.  The only thing I could do is file the tort against the neighbors who are smoking. This won't give me my health back, or find a safe place to live.
There are many of them (smokers) and it would do meNo good to sue sue, I just need to get away from the smoke. It's making me sick and my cat sick. I've even called homeless shelters but they won't let me stay because I have an apartment to stay in. 

I thought about buying a cheap van to live in until I can find another apartment, but then there's the whole hassle of parking and safety as a disabled woman sleeping in a van. 

I can pay up to 1,200/month.  Anything I haven't thought of? Tia 🤔",65,Portland

1nmb7xy,Proposal to Revitalize Urban Plaza Downtown,48,1758406566.0,"Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share a passion project of mine that I've been working on, using some of the things I've learned while studying Urban Planning at PSU and hoping to drum up some public support for this campaign.

I'm asking for support in revitalizing the 6th Avenue Fountain Plaza—known to skateboarders as “Half Circle.”

For over 40 years, skateboarders have used this space, but the presence of skate stoppers and other barriers currently limits its potential. Skateboarding fosters creativity, community engagement, and brings economic benefits by increasing foot traffic to local businesses.

I propose a phased approach to improve the Plaza:

Phase 1: Remove existing skate stoppers;

Phase 2: Remove boulders, invest in landscaping improvements, and introduce small, skateable elements.

Additionally, I recommend adding bike racks, seating, a water fountain and other amenities to support sustainable transportation and enhance the experience for all users.

If you feel moved to support this project please consider adding your name to the list of 166 people who have already signed on by filling out this brief Google survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6vcQoWCVQAnUqHLoJTKESmJNegvHYKSf8Jcr-ltLX8Nplvw/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6vcQoWCVQAnUqHLoJTKESmJNegvHYKSf8Jcr-ltLX8Nplvw/viewform)

There is also a section on that form, which is optional, where you can share any vision you have for the space. Feel free to dream big! No bad ideas. I know it's reddit, but I just ask that if you do fill out the form we try to keep the discourse positive, feel free to tear this apart in the reddit comments if you feel the need lol.

The idea is to use skateboarding as a tool to help reactivate this space, but my hope is that a vibrant Half Circle provides as many uses for as many people as possible.

Thanks!

It feels so futile to complain about given how so much of it is a result of bureaucratic decision making and special session delays, but I really worry that someone is going to get killed one of these days. Not to mention all the trash on the shoulders that ODOT doesn’t seem to clean anymore even though the layoffs have been postponed. I suppose the good news is that there seems to be less camping on city streets now that people have figured out you can camp on state property and not be bothered.

Hi there I work at Edwards Vacuum! We are / were a major sub-fab equipment supplier for Intel. They aren't buying systems anymore. We had several rounds of layoffs this year and a furlough. On Tuesday we were notified that only a quarter of us were to remain employed. Everyone else was dismissed that day! We were all given our termination date. Some of us will be gone by November, others by June of next year.

I am a software engineer that works here and my heart is completely ripped out by all of this. Our facility was beautiful, and it was a wonderful working environment. I've worked here for 4 years. I started as an intern and I've made so many memories and friends here. I think our ghosts will forever haunt this building whoever buys it.",52,Portland

1njnnw2,An Obituary for Lito (Or; The Guy Who Couldn't Play Guitar in Pioneer Square),1419,1758139341.0,"August 29^(th), one of our own passed on.  Some of you youngin’s with your new ways of smoking from anything other than a can may not remember him, but there used to be a legend in Pioneer Square—on the corner in front of the Nordstrom Café.  He wore blue latex gloves, a blue hoodie, and rocked a blue Pignose guitar with a built-in amp.  And God was it awful.  He played day and night—for years—decades even—but he never got any better.  He strummed every string he could in 4/8 time.  Didn’t matter where the other hand was on the neck.  All you’d hear when you got close to that corner above the traffic and the screech of the MAX and the homeless was the only song he knew by heart.  TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG TWANG—

 

His name was Joselito Abuan.  But my wife and her family called him Tito Tambo.  He was born in the Philippines, in Makati, back in 1961.  Lito wasn’t always like this.  Shouting about how he was a 5-star general and had land in Switzerland.  Believe it or not, he was a prodigy in chess.  Looked forward to becoming an engineer.  And as the only son of 6, his father looked to him like a rising star.  Then back in the 80’s, he moved to Portland with the rest of his family.  He tried to find a pot connection quickly rather than safely, and ended up losing his head.  From the sounds of it, he got a hold of some bad acid which kicked some latent schizophrenia into overdrive.

 

Unfortunately, Lito’s folks were willing to save a buck (“No no,” they’d say, “They just thought he’d do better back home.”  Say what you will).  Lito was sent back to the Philippines, a place known for their incorruptible leadership and understanding of mental illness.  He was sent to jail.  However long he was there was too long.  When he came back to America, he vowed not to return to the old country, and his father vowed that he would be the only caretaker his son would ever need.  Well, heavy smoker that he was, his father passed.  And his mother vowed to be the only caretaker that her son would ever need.  Well, healthy as she was, she was bed-ridden by a stroke and she passed on as well.

 

For the next 40 years, Lito was kicked between his sisters’ homes.  He’d care for their yards, watch their kids, help with the chores… but what really occupied his time was music.  He had a penchant for Fleetwood Mac and Steelers Wheel.  When he played downtown, he didn’t play for cash.  He played for the people.  Just know that when he was hitting every chord, he thought he was playing the same perfect rendition of “Stuck in the Middle With You” that he heard through his Walkman.  He made friends.  There was a man dressed all in blue with a blue turban and a beard dyed blue that Lito brought to his mother’s wake.  He called himself Kenny Loggins and served himself up a mountain of Chinese at the after-service buffet but damn if he wasn’t the nicest guy in the room.  Every month Lito’s family would come down to Pioneer Square and pay his tab at the food trucks that fed him.  Always the same, “He don’t cause no trouble.”

 

When I first met Tito Tambo, I found myself to have gravely misinterpreted what ‘crazy uncle’ meant.  I ended up in a hazing ritual where the entire set up was to just place the new guy in a corner with him.  Dude wouldn’t stop talking.  He talked about the millions he had in multiple accounts.  His military career as a 5-star general.  His airplane that was big enough to live on but all they needed was someone to fly it.  I don’t know why—probably boredom— but I said, “You know, I’m a pilot.”  I was maybe 17 or 18 and the only job I had was at the Dollar Tree.  But for all the past delusions Lito couldn’t remember, he never forgot that I was a pilot.

 

Lito always felt neglected at family parties to me, and I hated that.  I was soon promising to jam with him up in the office.  I pulled a bass off the wall.  We sat in uncomfortable chairs as he slid his headset on.  Guess I’d be following his lead.  “Well I don’t know how I got here tonight—”  Alright, Steelers Wheel it is.  We played together for maybe 20 seconds before he stopped.  “Wait!  Wait!  Wait!  Your bass is out of tune.  Here, give it to me.”  Great, gonna be a pain the ass to—  And then he played ‘Smoke on the Water’ perfectly.  Granted, it might be the first song a bass player learns, but I couldn’t fuckin’ believe it.  And the son of a bitch tuned my bass better than I could, too.  “There.  Okay.  Let’s start again.”  TWANG TWANG TWAND TWANG TWANG TWANG—  He was still better at chess than you, too.

 

Lito fell ill back in March.  Couldn’t swallow his food.  Turned out to be esophageal cancer.  I guess being a lifelong smoker will do that to you.  He didn’t want to go through with radiation therapy, though.  Thought that was the thing that killed his dad.  But once his sisters paid him a couple hundred bucks to go, he was ready to entertain them.  Didn’t believe it would work, of course, but told me as we sat in his hospital room that he was doing it to keep his sisters from nagging him.  Instead, he believed his home remedy would be the cure: he was gonna yank out his molar, focus on dental hygiene, and drink a mixture of peanut oil and rubber.  He tells me this as I look over his head and notice that his emergency contact is listed simply as ‘Kasparov”, the reigning champion of chess in the 80’s.

 

Who knows, maybe Tito Tambo had gotten the chance to try his own methods he’d still be annoying the passer-by’s in Pioneer Square today.  Instead, he passed August 29^(th) at the age of 64.  We buried him yesterday.",94,Portland

1nj0k3c,Need to rehome my cat (NE Portland),42,1758074294.0,"Hi, Portland,

We need to rehome my cat Lucy, who is not getting along with my roommate's dog and is experiencing stress.  Here's my write-up for Adopt-A-Pet:

Lucy is a healthy Female 3 year old, black/ white long haired, indoor/outdoor cat.

She is cute and cuddly and loves to curl up on the bed next to your leg or between yourself and your laptop.  She is a sweetheart and will be dearly missed.  She is intelligent, good with doors and rather quiet.

She also likes her YouTube cat TV.

For her best life, she needs a single pet home or a home with another cat (but no dogs). Due to some experiences in her first year (in her first home before ours), she does not get along well with dogs and is nervous around children under age 10.  She has otherwise done well with the other cat in our home.

She is spayed and is under the care of Hannah Pet Society in NE Portland.  You may assume our monthly dues ($79/month for any and all vet care) if you wish.

We will send her with bags of food, her feeder, carrier, litter box and toys, all of which will help her to acclimate to her new home.

Back when Spencer’s was still at the Lloyd center I worked there for a couple months before it closed and had some real freaky things go on that weren’t explainable. The biggest is what I call the White Windbreaker guy. 
I was alone in the store for a bit while my manager was in the back and I saw a guy in a white windbreaker with his hood up walk around a corner. I could hear his windbreaker too and I didn’t see him walk in so I went to greet him. I turned the corner maybe a few seconds after him and he was completely gone. I checked the hallway outside the store and didn’t see him anywhere. Few days later I’m asking my coworker there if they had seen anything, and they say they once saw a guy in a white windbreaker walk around a corner in the store and then vanish. That freaked me out but then things escalated. 
A couple weeks later we’re closing the store then what sounds like loud hammering shoot’s up and down the wall connecting us to an empty storefront. It shook the whole wall. I check the store next to us to see if anyone’s working in there and the lights are off and completely empty. Freaked me the fuck out. 
I haven’t really been able to ask anyone working there if they’ve had any similar experiences to that while at the Lloyd center so, if you’ve ever had any paranormal activity happen to you at the Lloyd center I’d love to hear it!!! The white windbreaker guy still freaks me out!",29,Portland

Sweet, healthy malamute waiting at MCAS since June",671,1757986471.0,"Coco is a sweet, beautiful 12 year old malamute who has been waiting at Multnomah County Animal Shelter (MCAS) since June, more than three months without a family. No senior dog should have to stay in the shelter this long!!!

[Link to Coco's Adoption Page](https://www.multcopets.org/adoptable/358684)

Coco came in as a stray with his sister, who had been with him his entire life. Sadly, when their owner was contacted, they said they no longer wanted them. His sister was quickly adopted, but Coco was left behind. Losing both his home and his companion broke his heart. He stopped eating, cried and howled all night, and lost over 10 pounds.

I fostered him for 3.5 weeks this summer and he was the most wonderful companion. He loves lounging in the yard, checking on his people, going for short walks, and even gets the cutest zoomies. He is potty trained, has great recall (fellow dog owners know how important this is!!!), is calm in the house, and bonds deeply with his humans.

Importantly, Coco is also in excellent health for his age! He has great mobility and still has lots of playful energy. Honestly, if I did not know his age, I would never guess it.

The best part is that Coco is a very chill dog. He is not high-energy or demanding, so he is perfect for someone who wants a sweet, steady companion without needing to run around all day. He loves his daily walk, then is happy to relax and soak up love. His mellow nature, cute malamute howl, and older gentleman personality make him an absolute treasure. He’s even a great brew dog!! I took him to a couple breweries where he settled easily and happily soaked up attention from anyone who came to say hi.

Last month, MCAS even featured Coco on their site after a generous community member donated a grooming session for him. You can see the sweet write-up and an adorable video of his bath here: [https://www.multcopets.org/news/round-apaws-dawb-rub-dub-dog-wash-gives-coco-glow](https://www.multcopets.org/news/round-apaws-dawb-rub-dub-dog-wash-gives-coco-glow)

Coco deserves the best home after everything he has been through. If you are looking for a loyal, goofy, loving senior with so much personality, please consider adopting him from MCAS, located at 1700 W Historic Columbia River Hwy, Troutdale, OR 97060

I also left a message for feral cat coalition - but they are closed until tomorrow. At the very least think they need antibiotics (the wound on their chest is very red and probably infected).

They're having an open rehearsal September 18 ahead of the fall session, which is a great opportunity for anyone to come check it out!

Voices Rock is a non-audition community choir for adults 18+ where members sing familiar rock and pop songs, and the only requirement is a love of singing. People of all musical backgrounds (including NO musical background!) are welcome. This is a super social choir and the goal is for everyone to make friends while having fun singing.

You'll learn the songs over 10 weeks and end the session with a final performance, backed by a full band! Rehearsals are Thursday nights, 6:30-7:45 pm.

But I may have overreacted.,629,1757773780.0,"I grew up in places where stores had bulletproof glass and supermarkets had people stopping you from exiting without signing off on your receipt. You know, they often wear a vest (sometimes they're third-party security while other times, they're hourly workers). Where I grew up, they were aggressive towards people who meet a certain profile - and let's just say that profile is people who look like me.

So when I discovered more places in Portland were implementing a ""Receipt Checker"", I rightfully got frustrated. I don't want to be treated like a criminal. And I was seeing them everywhere. Fred Meyers, Ross, even a thrift store.

After a full year, I'd say these receipt checkers are alright. Many times, it's been really pleasant. One guy showed me his marker collection. One made a funny comment about my donuts. One really tough-looking gal drew cat faces on my reciept.

I still think they shouldn't exist. And maybe the stores wish they didn't either.  And maybe people on the Pacific Northwest don't have rent-a-cop energy with sticks up their butts, compared to where I used to live.

I may have overreacted to the Receipt Checkers out there. Thanks for making it a tolerable experience.",518,Portland

She looked like she walked straight out of a movie, 500 Days of Summer type of scene. We danced near each other for a while, not caring about anyone else. She danced without trying, just being herself, light but not too light. Beautiful in a way that words don’t reach.

For a moment the world felt unreal. And then I remembered I’ll never have her. I’m not from here. I’m leaving soon, back to the other side of the world, Asia, my country. She made me lose hope in the rest of my life because I know I’ll never meet her again.

She wore a flower dress tonight. And I’m just a sensitive artist from the so-called third world. All I want is for this message to somehow reach her, to let her know how much I wanted her. If it were possible I wouldn’t go back. If it were possible I’d even ask her to marry me.

I know this sounds absurd. Maybe it is. But I had to write it down.

And yeah, I know this is a long shot. But hey, nobody here knows who I am, and she probably doesn’t even remember my face. Life already feels absurd because of her. What do I have left to lose lol.

Looking for a furry friend? Cedar and Lilac the kittens are taking adoption applications!

 Cedar is a friendly, playful, beautiful black, 10-week-old kitten. He loves looking out the window, scratches behind his head, and playing with feather toys. He would do well in a home with other cats, potentially dogs if slowly introduced, and older kids or younger pet knowledgeable kids or no children and indoor ONLY. He is especially interested in your application as he's gotten no interest yet :( 

Lilac is a shy and loving 10-week-old kitten. She purrs as soon as you pet her! She would do well in a home with other cats, very calm dogs in slowly introduced, and no / older children, indoor ONLY. She is slow to warm up and needs someone patient and compassionate to let her true colors show. 

The kittens were found lethargic and flea ridden. We were able to get them to the vet and get rid of the fleas and get them used to humans. They have made so much progress and are ready to find their furever home. 

To apply, please comment below or message me so we can give you the application link and answer any questions.

1neimrh,TIL: Portland Police Can Refer A Case To Restorative Justice Services Instead of Arresting Someone,59,1757620124.0,"Just learned that in Portland we have something called the Portland Community Justice Partnership. In short this is a relatively new program where the police can refer cases to a nonprofit who provides restorative justice services instead of arresting someone. The police are supposed to offer this option to people when they arrive on a scene but it sounds like they often aren't. However, anyone involved in a crime can ask for it, whether they're the perpetrator or the victim. If you're a crime victim you can even ask for it when you call the police to report what happened.

It's not available for certain very serious crimes like murder, rape, domestic violence, etc. But it sounds like they've had some good success so far with things like theft, hit and runs, and the like.

Both parties (perp and victim) have to agree to go this route before the case will be handed off to the nonprofit. If the person who committed the crime actively participates in the restorative justice process including effectively repairing with the victim they won't be arrested and won't have charges filed against them. But if they agree to participate and refuse to meaningfully engage, the case goes back to the police AND the DA has agreed to pursue charges against folks who get booted from the program.

Just wanted to spread the word about this because I had never heard of it and I think most other people haven't either! This post is pretty much all I know about it but you can check out their website [HERE](https://lcsnw.org/program/portland-community-justice/) or send any questions to rj@lcsnw.org or 971-888-7829. There are also volunteer opportunities available if anyone's interested, and they also offer non-crime related restorative justice services for a fee (sounds like this could be good for things like neighbor disputes over parking or a barking dog or something if both parties are willing to participate). But mostly, if you find yourself involved in a not super serious crime, be aware that you can ask for this!",18,Portland

1nega9u,Tabor Dance is a peace rally,1226,1757614711.0,"Mother Teresa said, ""I will never attend an anti-war rally; if you have a peace rally, invite me.""

Tabor Dance is a peace rally. It's where strangers can come together to share goodwill, positive energy, and joyful community. It's the world these locals want to live in, the world they promote with their presence.

The event looks like the scene at the end of The Grinch, where the town might be afflicted, yet the people came together in song and celebration. 

There are forces in this world that would like to see us divided, that thrive in making neighbors turn against each other. Our city needs peace rallies now more than ever. Tabor Dance is a frame of reference for what the world could be!

I know that stopping for pedestrians mid-block (not at a crosswalk) is fairly common here and not elsewhere (I learned this when I tried to stop for a pedestrian in another state and they seemed genuinely annoyed at me!) The other one I'm amused by is the polite and unspoken agreement to pull to the side to let another car pass first when there are cars parked on both sides (thus turning a two lane street into a tight fit). Obviously this is in our self interest - no one wants to damage their own or another's vehicle-but I can't imagine drivers in, say, Boston or Philly taking the time to self monitor the traffic flow. Are we just babies about tight spaces? Is this common road etiquette elsewhere and I just need to get out more? Just curious! ",384,Portland

1nd59q7,Reward: Lost Stuffed Bear (Update 1),37,1757480161.0,"Hello everyone, thank you for the incredibly kind outpouring following my post the other night. It has been a silver lining in an otherwise tough few days.

Unfortunately the bear has still not been found, and my partner is taking it very hard. She has not been eating or sleeping much the last few days, even crying so much she has begun to feel ill. The nice comments have been the only thing to make her smile so thank you again.

As for the hotel, it has continued to be very frustrating. As I wrote in a comment on one of the posts, I called the hotel yesterday where an employee told me that they knew where the bear was but I had to wait to hear from the housekeeping manager. I then called again where a second employee told me that they had found two bears in the room but had to wait several more hours to talk to the housekeeping manager who told me that they had not found any bears but that she was going to eventually send in someone to take the bed apart and look around.

I did not receive a call today, and when I called the housekeeping manager she did not call back. I called the hotel itself, only to be told that I can no longer talk to them and must go through the housekeeping manager.

I did email the corporate support line a few days ago, the response I got was they would basically tear the room apart to look for the bear, but they did not provide a timeline of when that would happen and I have not heard back.

It feels silly being so impacted by something like this with everything going on in the world, but this has really knocked us for a loop. My partner is truly devastated and I have spent multiple days with a pit in my stomach. All of this is made worse by the very real indifference we have felt from the hotel staff.

Once again, thank you for the kind words. I know many of you have said you don’t want/need the reward, but my partner and I are desperate and are upping it to $1000 in the hopes that does something.

As a bit of a numismatist, I’ve been scouring the PLANET for these bills for the past ten years. Recently went to visit an old friend and popped into a coin shop and saw a bunch of literature about DB Cooper. 

I came back the next morning and had a really good conversation with the guy that owned the place and told him that I’d looked in auctions—I had had Google notifications on in case anyone ever saw one of these bills or a photo even hit the internet. I just wanted to see one in person!

He’s like, I have all of them….

He’s asked me not to share location but he priced them out for me. I’m trying to repatriate at least one to the PNW. 

The only ones he doesn’t own are owned by the kid that found them—I believe he kept five and may have auctioned them off later. 

I got to take a photo with the three most complete bills. The cheapest is 5K and only a single round seal from one of the dilapidated bills without even a serial.

We are leaving this info here hoping that someone from the area can do something. It looks like the bird will be there in the weekend as the guy is always there.

Previous update: We wrote a message to the Bird Alliance of Oregon and they replied saying they don't have the resources and to call the Oregon Dept of Fish and WIldlife at 503 621 3488 or the Multnomah County Animal Services 503 988 7387.

We explained we want to let some bird or animal protection know but can't make phone calls and they didn't offer to help in any way and just said ""do what you have to do"" and went away.

1nbvpg6,"So I'm at New Seasons yesterday, and...",1001,1757356095.0,"Yesterday, I took the kiddo out to run some weekend errands.  We washed the car and got lunch, and needed to hit the grocery store for some dinner supplies and to drop off some green bags.  I dropped into the New Seasons on NE Broadway or Weidler or whatever the road is up there by the Freddy's.  We buy our food and then head down the ramp to drop off our recycling.

As I'm pulling up, I see the door is open and there's a dude reaching inside.  My first thought is this guy is trying to steal someone's cans but he's wearing like Hokas and like Brooks Brothers khaki shorts or something so I quickly dismiss that notion.  But still, I can hear cans and bottles rattling around.  I park and let the little guy out of the car seat, and open the trunk to get my bags, and by the time I'm ready to take em over the guy is like IN the bottle drop.  All I see now is one foot kinda wiggling against the door like he was getting swallowed up by a time warp or a big whale or something.  The kiddo is like ""Ummmm, daddy?"" and I'm also like ""Uhhhh..."" and then the foot disappears and the door slams shut.  ""Brooks"" has been eaten by the bottle drop and I'm really not sure how to proceed.

So, after some quick reflection I decided the dude probably needs help and also I'm way too curious at this point to take the bottles somewhere else.  Plus, the kiddo is out of the car seat and getting him back in is a whole thing so I'm like ""OK, let's see where this goes.""  I scan my card and open the door and there's this dude just standing in there.  I say ""Hi there.  Um, what's up?"" or some dumb thing like that and he tells me he was trying to get a sticker on a bag he'd just tossed in but now he's stuck and the door in there is locked from the outside (for obvious reasons, I think).  I tell him, ""OK, I'll head into the store and get someone to come down to help"".

The kiddo and I walk up the ramp and he's like PUMPED.  Neither of us have ever seen anything like this and we both think it's pretty funny but also super weird, like honestly WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.  We go inside and I find the person working the self-checkout and tell them what's up.  I'm like ""so, I just saw a dude get swallowed up by the bottle drop downstairs"" and they look at me and they're like ""....coooooool...""  I tell them they look ""normal"", like, aside from the fact that they're inside the bottle drop deposit and locked in, but not like, you know, ""weird"".  And they're like ""...coooooool..."" again but then they're like ""OK, let me try to figure out who to talk to to go help out."".

So me and the buddy go downstairs again and back around to the bottle drop because obviously we need to see where this goes and also I still want to drop these bags off but probably not when there's some dude trapped in there or it's a vortex or something.  We get to the spot and an employee in an apron comes out the regular door - you know, the door authorized people are supposed to use to go in and out of the bottle drop - and he shrugs at me and says ""there's nobody in there.""

And I'm thinking WHAT.  I tell him ""OK, but I totally saw a dude crawl in through the door and get swallowed up in there and the employee is like ""oh, I know, I know, I watched him do it!  we all did."" and he points to a camera on the ceiling inside the door.  Then he proceeds to check inside the big blue bins in there, like the ones you'd drag out to the street that would definitely be big enough to hide a full grown person in.  He opens them both slowly like its a jack-in-the-box.  

THEY'RE BOTH EMPTY.  

The man has disappeared.

I don't know what happened to Brooks, but I really hope someone who was working at the New Seasons early yesterday afternoon (or for deniability, a close friend of theirs who definitely heard this story yesterday) is on this sub and can fill me in.

I have just returned from a vacation around the Pacific Northwest. This past Thursday, 9/4, my girlfriend and I stayed at the Kimpton Vintage Portland room 606. We were in a rush in the morning and unfortunately lost her stuffed bear, a substantially sentimental item from her grandmother. She has been beside herself with panic attacks and frankly, the hotel has not been the most responsive, consistently only looking at a webpage to see if the bear has been “logged.” 

We are certain the bear is either behind/under the bed or in the laundry. We are offering a $750 reward (in addition to expedited shipping) for the return of the bear. Please… help us.

When they were weaned we took them in and got them fixed and vaccinated through feral cat coalition last week. We have two cats already so would love to find them some new homes. They are all still a little nervous with humans so would need a new owner with the patience to keep working on socializing but we’ve seen them grow so much already and are confident they will one day be great companions. I can get most of them to purr while being pet and two will allow being held and getting pet in my lap. Please reach out to me if interested and we can set up a time to meet them.

There is one female grey tabby, two brown tabbies one male and female and one black female. It would be awesome if anyone wanted to take two as kittens often do better together. All have been fixed and vaccinated, but were too young for rabies vaccine. We think they are about 12 weeks. They all have a little clip in their ear that’s not visible in photos from when fcc did the procedure. It’s hardly noticeable but happy to send updated pics. I live in east Portland area. 

I have an appointment yo give them to pixie project at the start of next month if I don’t find them homes between now and then. And if the two more skiddish ones don’t socialize more and meet their criteria they will go to the humane society and hopefully become barn cats.

I’m now seeing gridlock on Stark and Washington st in montavilla due to change from 2 lanes to one,  something I’ve never seen before

These roads and the roads they feed are fully capable of handling 2 lanes of traffic,  in fact it moved traffic more efficiently,  now I’m waiting through 3 and 4 traffic signal cycles just to move 1/4 mile

Now each light cycle only permits 4-5 cars to cross 82nd at a time, that road feeds I205!  Wtf would they restrict outflow to a highway?!

Due to the paw-sitive (haha) response from the last dog I highlighted, I want to do another.

Yesterday, my husband and I went and looked at [Reggie](https://www.petfinder.com/dog/reggie-mcas-77633110/or/troutdale/multnomah-county-animal-services-or57/). He is an 80lb bundle of love! We took him out in the yard to play with him, and the person showing him to us said he's being overlooked due to skin allergies. He is the happiest boy with a goofy personality! They said he was found as a stray, but seemed to be well socialized around people and other dogs. He will need medicated baths regularly and possibly a special diet to help with his skin, but otherwise he would make a perfect dog for a family!

Again, I do not work at or volunteer at this shelter. I am just trying to help dogs get adopted :)

Until now a friend and I have been taking care of him, but the issue is we both have other pets that are the one-dog-per-house type, and it is seeming like Buddy may lean that way too. 

He’s had a really rough life, but he’s such a good boy. He has settled down a lot and gotten more used to living the good life. He needs someone who wants only one dog, is patient, willing to work on training, and has a lifestyle that fits with his high energy and brute strength. 

Ideally someone that can bring him along to work or wfh, and someone active themselves who takes him adventuring with them. 

He’s good at dog parks, too much for cats, very loyal, very attentive, and very snuggly. 

All rescue places are filled to the brim so now I am left wondering…can the magic of Reddit help me find Buddy’s soul mate? In another world, where I didn’t already have a zoo, I would absolutely keep him myself. He is such a joy to be around.

1n82505,Still looking for a new home for Winston - somewhat urgent,142,1756965157.0,"Hi all. I posted a little over a month ago about rehoming my rabbit, Winston. I've been unsuccessful in finding him a new home and it's starting to take a toll on everyone in the home-him, my cat, and myself. The situation is becoming more dire and I'm looking to rehome him as soon as possible.
We're on the waiting list for the Humane Society, but the wait could still be another couple of months. It breaks my heart to see how this living situation is impacting both of them and it's kicking my mental health's ass.
Thanks for reading.

I'll paste the original post's text below:

“Last Christmas I brought home a rabbit for my roommate and I. We were like platonic dads to this little guy and we both love him dearly.

He and I had to part ways from our living situation (a slumlord slapping bandaids on gaping wounds, we couldn’t stay any longer) and we both had to downsize—him to a studio, me to a one bedroom with myself, my rabbit, and a cat.

Our rabbit went from having his own bedroom, a whole upstairs floor of a house, and a backyard to a large cage with limited time to free roam. I work too much and don’t feel comfortable leaving him out alone with our cat (as docile, old, and chonk as he may be).

Ultimately it’s become apparent that my sweet boy’s quality of life has taken a hit and he deserves much better. I’m stressed out knowing that I’m unable to provide him with the care, space, and attention he needs.

I’m looking to rehome him with someone who has more space and either the time or people around to pay him as much attention as he needs. Ideally someone with a yard, but if not then plenty of space to roam. He comes with a large cage (if you’d like), a litter box, potty pads, some bedding, a big bag of hay, and tons of pellets/additives and treats. I can provide nail clippers as well. I’d prefer that someone with experience with caring for small animals takes him, but if not that’s okay too—I can provide you with as much information as possible.

He’s just over a year old and has not yet been neutered. It was first on the list of priorities once my finances recover from the move, but I’ve been in the new place for less than a month and I’m unfortunately not there yet. Other than that he’s perfectly healthy and full of love and life.

Please go easy on me—this isn’t what I wanted by any means. My cat and I have both bonded with him, he’s my boy. I just want to see that he goes to the right home. Having to rehome him is devastating and whoever gets this wild little spirit is lucky.”",18,Portland

1n7zs9n,Mr. Blue needs a home. Let it be yours!,255,1756957203.0,"Meet Mr. Blue. He's an extremely sweet gray cat who absolutely loves attention. He previously lived in a 300 sqft home (room, really) with 2 other cats, which caused him immense stress to the point where he was urinating outside of the litter box.

Mr. Blue was dropped off voluntarily at a vet for euthanization due to his 'inappropriate urination'. The owner dropped him off, told the vet the situation, then left.

I found out about this quickly and called the vet to arrange to take him in instead of letting him die. The vet tech I talked to told me that she was going to take him in, monitor his habits, then set him up for adoption.

She's had him for a few weeks, and Mr. Blue has not peed outside of his litter box at all. We both think that the previous living situation (300sqft, multiple cats, etc) was stressing him out to the breaking point. Taking him out of that situation seems to have completely remedied that.

We think he's absolutely ready to live in a healthy environment as an only cat.

Mr. Blue is neutered. He's extremely sweet, is very playful, and loves getting attention. I would take him in myself, but I already have multiple cats and as I said before, he would most likely thrive in a situation as an only cat.

One last important note: Mr. Blue has had a urinary blockage in the past. He had to have surgery to correct it. He's fine now, but in order to prevent future urinary blockages, the vet recommends putting him on a urinary diet from now on. 

Please help me find Mr. Blue a new home!",18,Portland

The west side is better than the east side. Here’s why. Gullies, tall trees, and windy quiet streets through SW and the NW hills. Still pretty well served by transit considering how residential most of the west side is. The south waterfront is gorgeous to look at from afar or explore, and Terwilliger is one of the most beautiful places in the city to walk, run, or bike. The trails leading up toward OHSU and up to Fairmount Drive are wonderful as well. You have incredibly easy access to downtown from all of SW via Barbur, and from most of NW via Burnside/Skyline. Performing arts, shopping and dining, and a massive public university downtown. Gorgeous views back to downtown from both the West Hills and Kings Heights. Top notch neighborhood corridors like Multnomah Village, NW 23rd, and the Pearl. Amazing access to the river at Willamette park and several houseboat communities. Tryon Creek State Park. Two highly rated public high schools and many well regarded elementary and middle schools. While it may be easy to say that these are all things that require some degree of wealth to enjoy, the east side (west of ~50th) is comparably expensive to live in. The east side certainly has lots of desirable commercial strips, but who needs that many? The west side has a manageable amount of quality businesses. Also, it has a surprising amount of diversity if you know where to look (but unfortunately admittedly less than the east side). I love all of Portland. But the west side is the best side.

""Project-based action is how we get to know each other a little bit more than just saying Hi.""

""You get to break barriers to connecting with people from so many different backgrounds. This is proof that we can work together, and this does not have to be an isolated event.""

""It's a rare moment of community in the current age.""

**MY RECENT THOUGHTS ON MAXIMIZING IMPACT:**

\---> ***TOH MUST BE REMOVED SAFELY & WITH PROPER TECHNIQUE.***

* Folks are unclear on PPE, herbicide types, and technique, and can easily hurt themselves, others, or the natural environment, especially using Triclopyr. Glyphosate is safer for several reasons, go read all about it... TLDR: use only [this](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/compare-n-save-concentrate-grass-and-weed-killer-41-glyphosate-1118710) & read the label (!!!), wear long sleeves, pants, closed-toe footwear, latex gloves, and apply the minimum amount necessary in late summer/early fall (now!).
* Chopping down TOH makes it grow back stronger. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKLW2TXS1jg) is a good intro (Penn State U Extension)

1npwrj9,How to put a few hundred dollars (+ a few volunteers) to good use for those who are under-resourced in our community?,8,1758772180.0,"I have a few hundred dollars stashed away from birthdays and Christmas money received over the years. I wanted to do something special with it but was never sure what. Well, I finally decided that I really don't need to spend it on myself, so I'm looking for a local organization that is doing good work in the community where I could not only donate it, but preferably also volunteer in some capacity to carry out whatever I was funding. I'm sure I could find a few (or more) friends to join me if a few other bodies were needed.

An example of what I mean would be sponsoring a meal for the unhoused, then serving the meal with other volunteers. I know Jewish Family Services does this.

However, I would ideally like to sponsor something that would give someone the resources to better their life situation in a longer-term capacity than feeding them a single meal. I'm not sure of what all is out there, but maybe paying for materials for some sort of course or workshop could be an example?

Is anyone aware of any organizations or community groups that would be a good fit for what I'm looking for?

If it sparks any ideas, I'm passionate about helping immigrants, low-income and/or single-parent households, the unhoused, and also the natural environment. I'm a solopreneur so helping someone start a business in some way could also be cool since I'm in business for myself, too.

I know I'm not going to save anyone or change the world with this donation/volunteering, but this money is special to me in its own way so it would mean a lot to me to be able to use it in a meaningful way as I've described here. If it's an especially good fit, I'm also open to considering something that would turn into an ongoing volunteer engagement (though the funds would be a one-time thing).

I got a fix-it ticket for two burned out tail lights. I fixed them and went to the local sheriff's office to have the fix approved. Since I don't want to drive to Vista, they told me to call Vista Traffic Court to find out how much to send them by mail. 1) they only answer the GD phone from 8:30am to 11:30am. WTF IS THAT?!? 2) the recorded message said to go to their website www.sdcourt.ca.gov. The only thing I can find online there is to pay the full fine of $193. I was under the impression the fixed tail lights would be cheaper than that. Plus, the wording online appears that I am paying a full fee without contest or something.

Can handle parties of 20
Open late
Serves alcohol AND real food

Bonus if you can dance or participate in something while at the venue

I was leaving The Shops and this dude took pics of my front and back plates. When I asked who they were and what they were doing, they refused to disclose the information and said they didn’t have to tell me.

So I pulled back around and took a video and pictures of them. I don’t know who they are, but I talked to the mini mall’s private security, who said they had already contacted law-enforcement.

I have also applied to the local 206 for their apprenticeship program. Their test is in October, but yet it's a lengthy process to get in, and I'm not even sure I'll get in. So I need help. If anybody knows of any place actively hiring, I'd be happy to give a hand. I don't mind commuting any distance; and I don't mind any shift. Day, mid or night I'll do anything.

This is especially for you folks that are long-term renters, paying below market, in units where the original owners sell due to age, and the developers out there hungrily looking for these older apartment complexes to evict you, paint the walls and re-rent for 100%+ more. They cannot just kick you out. 

Please look at your rights. San Diego's tenant protections are only in the actual metro of SD. 

California has its own protections that are pro tenant, but San Fran, LA and finally SD build upon the state's laws and enact greater protections. 

Im not going to debate the merits of the law.  Not going to get into the downside or upside of these laws. You all want to debate the pros and cons here- please feel free to have discourse/debates/fights about the protections. 

Im just here to say if you are a renter and in any way losing your place through no fault of your own- look at our laws that were enacted in June of 2023.

1nopoy3,How is anyone supposed to actually live here?,911,1758653036.0,"I’ve been in San Diego for 3 years now and I swear every time I think I’m finally catching up, the city finds a new way to knock me down. Rent for a *basic* one-bedroom in North Park or Normal Heights is pushing $2,200+, gas hovers around $5, groceries are insane, and parking tickets feel like a tax for existing. I make decent money on paper (around $65k), but it feels like I’m just surviving, not living.

What makes it worse is that even when you’re responsible, this city still punishes you. I had one late rent payment last year when I was between jobs, literally 12 days late, and it tanked my credit. Now, even though I’ve never missed a payment since, landlords want to treat me like I’m a liability. I’ve been asked for 2 months’ rent upfront *plus* a cosigner for an apartment that’s barely bigger than a closet. I have literally no idea how to build my credit score back again.

I love the weather, the beaches, the food, all of that’s amazing. But honestly, what’s the point if you’re constantly stressing about money? I can’t be the only one wondering if San Diego is really worth it anymore.

Edit: I get it. I really get it, that $65k is not enough to live here and I'm trying my best to get that number up. But some things are out of my hand which wont let me move out. For the credit score part, some good folks DMed debit cards that report to credit bureaus like Fizz and Chime. I'll look into them give a try.

I downloaded my green button data for the last year and wrote a little script that calculated how much the energy costs under both plans. It seems like I come out with a small surplus credit under my current plan and a larger surplus credit under the EV plan. 

My understanding is that since the amount of surplus kwh is actually the same though, the amount of compensation I’d get back is the same for either plan, right? So my conclusion is that for me it wouldn’t make sense to switch. But if I ever got to a point where I owed money under my current plan then it might make sense to switch (provided I owe more than the extra difference is monthly fee). Does that sound right?

1no0waj,SDGE Is Requesting $21 Million For A Risky Hydrogen Blending Experimental Facility. Guess Who Is Paying That Bill? Join Public Power San Diego on Sep 26th to say NO to SDGE's Cash Grab! (More Info In Comments),102,1758580872.0,"# Say NO to Dangerous Hydrogen Blending in San Diego

**SDGE is proposing a $21 million hydrogen blending “demonstration project” a profit-seeking experiment that will stick San Diegans with the bill.**

This project doesn’t move us toward a clean energy future. It’s designed to **delay electrification**, keep pipelines alive, and protect utility profits. All while putting our health and safety at risk.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is holding **two public hearings in San Diego on Friday, September 26 at 2pm and 5pm.** We need a strong turnout to show that our community rejects SDGE’s dangerous distractions.

# How You Can Take Action

**1. Submit a Written Comment (by Sept 26)** Tell the CPUC why you oppose this project and why San Diego should prioritize real climate solutions.

* Click “Add Public Comment”  
* Enter your name, address, and email  
* Write a short statement in your own words (see template below)

👉[ Submit Written Comments Here](https://apps.cpuc.ca.gov/apex/f?p=401:56::::RP,57,RIR:P5_PROCEEDING_SELECT:A2209006)

# Example Written Comment

My name is \_\_\_ and I live in \_\_\_. I oppose SDGE’s hydrogen blending project because it puts our health and safety at risk, passes unnecessary costs onto ratepayers, and delays the transition to clean electric buildings. I urge the CPUC to cancel this project and support proven solutions like electrification, rooftop solar, and storage. Thank you.

**2.** **For greater impact** **Speak In-Person at the Public Hearing**

* **Date:** Friday, September 26, 2025  
* **Times:** 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm  
* [RSVP HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZgZXJsXIVxsAKGee5bD7QLPvrJSWVO9jGPubRVJ6tDTv4HA/viewform?usp=header)
* **Location:** United Way of San Diego, County Conference Room 100A, 4699 Murphy Canyon Rd, San Diego, CA 92123

Sign up at the Public Advisor’s table when you arrive. Remarks are limited to 1 minute.

# Why This Project Is Wrong for San Diego

* **Minimal climate benefit:** Experts agree hydrogen blending does little to cut emissions.
* **Higher risks:** Hydrogen is more explosive than natural gas, leaks more easily, and produces more lung-damaging NOx. The American Medical Association formally opposes hydrogen blending in homes and buildings.  
* **Ratepayer burden:** SDGE is asking the CPUC to charge us $21 million for an experiment that benefits their bottom line, not the public.  
* **Better alternatives exist:** Local rooftop solar, battery storage, and full electrification are safer, cheaper, and available now.  

Even without hydrogen, gas appliances already pollute our homes. Studies from Stanford and Harvard link gas stoves to asthma, cancer risks, and benzene exposure equivalent to secondhand smoke. Blending hydrogen only makes things worse.

This is a **dangerous, expensive, and unnecessary project.** San Diego should not be a test site for risky fossil fuel experiments.

# Talking Points for Comments

* I oppose SDGE’s hydrogen blending demonstration project.  
* We need to transition off gas — not prolong it with dangerous hydrogen experiments.  
* The American Medical Association opposes hydrogen blending due to explosion risks and harmful NOx emissions.  
* San Diego should invest in electrification, rooftop solar, and storage instead.  
* This project is a cash grab — San Diegans should not be forced to pay $21 million to boost SDGE’s monopoly profits.
* These hearings prove why we need **Public Power**: an energy system that puts people and the planet before profit.

**Thank you for speaking up. Together, we can protect San Diego from SDGE’s profiteering and push for a truly clean, people-powered energy future.**",29,SanDiego

I’ve run into a snag with my build and figured I’d throw this out there to see if anyone local might be able to help.

I’ve got an ASUS TUF Gaming X570-Plus WiFi motherboard and a Ryzen 7 5800X CPU. Problem is, the board doesn’t have BIOS FlashBack, and my BIOS is too old to recognize the 5800X — so the system powers on, but won’t POST.

To update the BIOS, I need a compatible CPU that will actually boot on this board. That means anything from the Ryzen 3000 series (e.g., 3600, 3700X, etc.) should work. I don’t need to keep it, I’d just like to borrow it long enough to flash the BIOS.

I know it’s a long shot, but if anyone nearby has a spare chip that works with X570 they’d be willing to lend or let me test with, I’d really appreciate it. Happy to provide collateral, meet in public, or work out whatever makes you comfortable.

1nmorns,Shipping Motorcycle from Hawaii to California after frame swap,0,1758451481.0,"Hello,

I’m in kind of a tricky situation and wanted some advice.

- I’m a college student in California, but my bike (2025 Yamaha R7) is still in Hawaii.

- The OEM frame got swapped out for an aftermarket reinforced steel frame. The new frame has a legit VIN and MCO.

- Pasha (the shipper) says they need active registration or temporary registration, which I assume is a California temporary operating permit, one-trip permit. I don’t believe that Hawaii offers temporary registration.

Pasha: “To ship a vehicle from Hawaii, we will need a current registration. That registration does not have to be from Hawaii, and we can accept temporary registration as long as it is valid at the time of shipment.”

- Ideally, I’d rather just ship the bike as-is with the new VIN + MCO, then do the full registration in California. I do NOT want to deal with the whole safety and reregistering in Hawaii, just to have to redo it in California 😭

My questions:
 1.	Has anyone shipped a motorcycle with only an MCO (no active registration)?
 2.	Does California DMV allow you to register a bike with a new frame VIN/MCO straight from out-of-state?
 3.	Is there a way to bypass having to re-register in Hawaii?
 4. What does Pasha mean by “temporary registration?” Will Pasha allow a temp operating permit/one-trip permit?

Thanks.

ABC acquiesced to that pressure from affiliate networks Nextstar and Sinclair by removing Kimmel’s show indefinitely. This is direct action from the FCC, federal government, and Prez to suppress free speech, in direct violation with the first amendment. Be clear; The Director of the FCC knew what he was saying—he is a skilled government tactician who wrote the FCC chapter of Project 2025 (starts on p845, if you're looking for a good time). 

**Taking action:** This crap seems hopeless sometimes, but the affiliate networks have one huge vulnerability: they cannot survive without advertisers. So, to take action, your best bet is to applying pressure to advertisers who support the affiliate stations. In San Diego, **KSWB FOX 5 and KUSI** are [owned by Nextstar](https://www.nexstar.tv/stations/). There are no Sinclair stations in San Diego. 

**A quick call, email, google review, yelp review, or other message works:**

""I’m a customer of yours \[relate any story you can\] and I noticed your company is an advertiser on FOX5/KUSI. Your ad dollars are going to a station owned by Nexstar, the network that is suppressing free speech. I want you to know that I will boycott your company until you stop supporting FOX 5 and KUSI, or when Nexstar changes its stance to support free speech over government censorship.""

As a mod here I can't tell you about how difficult it is, to have a parent or grandparent be lost and the delay cause by the families NOT having all their info available and ready for a search.  Then to find out that the delay resulted in that missing persons passing.   

Having their pictures and info ready and at hand with law enforcement would have enabled a police officer to stop them when first sighted and saved their life vs continue driving along and not recognizing them until AFTER the families finally got the photo's uploaded and distributed.

1nlq9nr,Downtown San Diego isnt for you,782,1758347639.0,"a rant

just say that. why all the hating? 

I see these posts about downtown, and the majority of it is from people who lived here a decade to go or who only visit for games and events and have the most to say as if where they live is perfect

I've seen more Padres fans and drunk people from bars pissing on the streets than I ever have from a homeless person. Y'all come down here and piss everywhere and trash the place litter like unbelievably, and then get on the Internet and talk about how terrible it is to be here

Is there a lot of homeless people? Yeah 
Do they bother people the way Reddit likes to say they do? No 

I watch the local news and in the last three years I've not seen one story about a homeless person attacking anybody it's always somebody who's drunk and fighting or something similar. Not saying it doesn't happen, but it's not happening at the rate everybody likes to believe it is

I live here and I am walking my dogs about three hours a day throughout the day and evening in total I am on foot around my neighborhood all day long I see and hear most everything and it is nowhere near as dramatic as people make it.

I've seen more women harassed by men at the bars or on the street corners waiting for Ubers or whatever than I ever have from a homeless person 

But somebody will take one story from 20 years ago and run with it until the end of time   

Y'all really act as if Hillcreast is any safer. Hillcreast is crawling with meth addicts

downtown living is a lifestyle. If you're not built for it, just say so. Stay up in your boring suburbs where you have to drive every single place you go spending a lot of money in gas and parking and everything else.

There's plenty of advantages of living in downtown San Diego.  

*Still 15 minutes from numerous beaches. 

*Can go to all the Padres games and events and whatever and never worry about parking

*The only place you need to drive to is the dispensary, which can be delivered 

*if you are a drinker you can party until your heart's content and not to worry about an expensive Uber, late night train ride or driving Drunk to get home

i'm not here to convince anybody to live in downtown but I am getting annoyed at the rhetoric about how unsafe and how unclean it is when I see with with my own two eyes every day the safety and the clean issues not coming from the homeless be coming from people who visit here for events and then trash it and then leave 

Downtown San Diego is not meant to be like other downtowns in most cities. It's San Diego. Nobody is moving here to be in downtown. People move to San Diego for the beach and the weather and things like that which can be had from most neighborhoods around the county

I was here as a kid, but ended up moving and grew up in New York City and I lived in Los Angeles for over a decade so I've been to many downtown areas and this one? Is a fucking daycare comparatively speaking. If you can't handle downtown San Diego if it's so scary and so sketchy then you probably should never visit another downtown and any other major city on a coast

also everyone acts like downtown is strictly gaslamp and East Village. There is Little Italy, Cortez Hill, Balboa, Marina District, bankers hill etc those neighborhoods are ALL downtown san diego. 

if you don't like it so much or if it's so bad just stay your ass home. Stop going to the Padres games when that happens maybe they'll clean it up more to your liking 

and no I have nothing better to do right now than to give you a word salad rant about people's shitty takes on downtown ",468,SanDiego

New lease was hit by city trash truck in August. Car was gone for a month being repaired by a place Allstate backs. 

$8500 repair, $1k deductible. Been a nightmare with that, it has some flaws from the repair (trying to sort that). I feel like the car surely lost some worth.
 
Truck is at fault. I’ve lost wages, I have 24/7 wrist pain, emotional trauma, toddler car seat replacement, no car for a month (wasn’t able to fork over the rental cost upfront and hope I’m reimbursed one day).

This happened on my street that I have lived on for 35 years, so it’s a constant reminder! I also have to continue to hear/see this man in his truck each week on his route for my street…or do they trade off?

1nli6e1,Dermatologist in SD that can help me with a scar,9,1758322902.0,"I am scarred (literally and figuratively) from a dermatologist in El Cajon that sliced off a mole of mine without asking. This was about a year ago and i don’t even think he’s practicing anymore. If he was I would beg him to stop. But I won’t go into the dirty details of this awful appointment besides the fact that his “biopsy” i.e. slicing off a mole of mine and then never even calling me to tell me the results of said biopsy left its mark on me. He did not tell me that the biopsy meant cutting it off btw. I assumed it was scraping a few cells or something. A little communication would have gone a long way. 

Do doctors get paid per mole removal? He tried to convince me to cut off a bunch of them—none cancerous btw. I literally was only there to get screened for skin cancer. Now I have this raised puffy scar on my shoulder where he removed my mole. I thought it would heal flat but it looks like someone put a cigarette out on me. It’s big and pinkish purple. I actually cry about it sometimes because it just used to be a cute flat mole and now it’s a lump of unsightly scar tissue. I haven’t dealt with it because I’m worried about just getting another shitty dermatologist trigger happy with a scalpel. But it makes me actively upset because it’s very obvious (I live in tank tops). 

Does anyone know a dermatologist that specializes in scar stuff? Ideally getting it to flatten out or something? I can’t even tattoo over this to disguise it. I’ve considered going full gen z and putting those pimple patches on it just to not have to look at it but it’s too damn big. I have sharp health care, ideally somewhere that will that that. Reaching out in a moment of desperation because I’m so mad at myself for letting this freaky old man cut off a part of my body for nothing. Need a happier ending. I’m pretty amateur in the health care world, it took a lot for me to make the cancer screening apt in the first place. ",8,SanDiego

1nlg469,Downtown San Diego is an Enigma,447,1758317537.0,"I was born and raised in San Diego (in the suburbs). During a party animal phase in my late 20s I lived in Downtown SD for 6 years. I loved it - didn't own a car, got 10k steps in every day and went out on weekends

In 2021 I moved to Miami (Brickell) and I remember the first thing that stood out to me was how clean and active it was compared to DTSD. At any given time of day the streets are bustling - people walking dogs, exercising, going out to eat, or to work. Brickell completely revived downtown Miami over the past few years with just the right mix of jobs, people, restaurants, and even a shopping mall that's always packed

Now when I visit downtown San Diego it feels like a ghost town. There's no one out during the day south of Broadway because there's no jobs. There's no shopping (we know about Horton Plaza) and it just feels like there's no reason to be in downtown unless you party - at night the streets come alive. 

I know SD has more neighborhoods to offer than just DT, more than other major cities, but what's crazy is that the condos in DT hold their value and it keeps getting prohibitively more expensive. Yet the people that live here don't go out in the day. 

After experiencing other downtowns more its weird to me. I hope the Horton Plaza office project gets picked back up and can revitalize DT with young professionals to bring more life to it during the day.",217,SanDiego

Where I’m looking is central San Diego, not North County (No San Marcos or Escondido. Mission Valley, Uptown (anywhere along University, El Cajon, Adams, Washington), etc. South of 52 and North of 94. 

This exists in other places. They exist in Denver, Houston, Germany, UK, etc. I’m sure elsewhere in the US. I don’t want a Dave & Busters. Usually called. Biergarten, Bierhaus, beer garden. A food hall.

Somewhere that’s sort of casual, but good food and drink options. Families can hang out and let the kids run around. And yeah, I know a lot of people don’t want to hear screaming kids. Go somewhere else like a bar?

The new Olive Street Park sort of has this being next to Communal Coffee. Izola downtown off Faultline Park downtown almost does. Station Tavern in South Park is decent. Stone at Liberty Station sort of meets the mark but every time I’ve gone the vibe seems more like business meeting or weekend brunch than family hangout. 

I’m looking for somewhere my kid can run around with other kids, maybe a playground but at least dig in the dirt, and then the parents can chill and drink beer or a glass of wine and eat some snacks while chatting and watching their kids play. Options I’m aware of are limited.

Any help in that area would be appreciated.

I was appalled to learn that the assistant director of Animal control, who works for the San Diego County Department of Animal Services has been promoting mass euthanasia of dogs, raising the rate of killings skyward and believes even more killings should occur. Her name is Rachael Borelli and employing her means the SD County Department  of Animal Services is advocating that more and more dogs should be killed. 

One woman reported she had to return a dog because her other dog wouldn't accept him. She reported he was a great dog and was assured he would not be euthanized. Rachael Borelli signed his euthanasia forms and had him killed soon after the woman left the building. The next day, she decided she would try to find another way to keep the dog and came back for him, but of course, he had already been killed.

A kind soul on reddit explained my mistake in believing that this Department, like other SD Animal Control Departments, was directly controlled by the SD Humane Society. I humbly Apologize for my mistake. The kind Reddit person instead thoughtfully directed me to the SDCounty Department of Animal Services. I have been unable to find any way to complain to them directly but have sent a query to their general contact email: dasinfo@sdcounty.ca.gov

If anyone knows a better contact info, I would appreciate the information.

Knowing this, it is difficult to understand how the County of San Diego, who asks for public donations on their Animal Services webpage,  could be so inhumane as to allow this terrible woman to even work for Animal Control, let alone employ her as the assistant director of Animal Control, which in her eyes means Animal Murder. One of her workers was so fed up she became a whistle blower,  releasing a voicemail where Borelli was swearing and advocating for even more dog deaths. Two other employess who left their jobs said that they were not surprised by the viocemail message.

Fortunately, this was reported on KPBS. I hope anyone who reads this will join me in complaining. If enough of us care, and take just 5 minutes to email a complaint, we can make a difference and save dog lives. It is a free and takes just a small amount of time

I need to sell two cars. One is a 2015Fiat 500e and the other is a 2001 BMW Z3 Roadster. Both in great shape. Here are my questions for those that might have more knowledge about the process.

1) How do I ensure I don't get scammed? Have we gotten to a point where the only options are cash or drawing a cashier's check in person? I'm assuming none of the electronic payment methods are safe due to the possibility of hacked accounts and stolen credit cards.

2) I plan to use a Bill of Sale stating the sale is ""as is"" and final. I will also fill out the pink slip and file the necessary NRL on the DMV website. But this is where it gets weird. The NRL is supposed to document that I I have sold the car and are no longer liable. However, the DMV website says that it will still be in my name until the buyer registers it. I've heard horror stories about the buyer never registering it and the seller getting tickets (and worse) months later.

So how do I go about this the right way to protect myself? I guess this is why people sell to lowballers like Carmax :)",35,SanDiego

Let me set the scene: rush hour traffic, all lanes are bumper to bumper cruising at 10-15mph when an old, blue, beat to hell car (maybe a camry or something adjacent) comes up behind us playing real life fucking GTA.

He was cutting through the middle of lanes, taking everyone’s mirrors with him. He side swiped me, and literally rock crawled his vehicle across the hood of the car next to me. His car was at a 45 degree angle with just two wheels on the ground. Kept going. 

I would guess he hit over 20 cars.

I already called it in and they brought CHP out but I’m hoping someone saw it or ideally caught it on a dashcam. Let me know if you did.

1nivrbr,Restaurants for Sitting a Long Time,16,1758061415.0,"
Short Version:
Looking for restaurants in San Diego where you order at a counter, seat yourself, and can stay a long time talking without inconveniencing others. Extra points if it's relatively quiet, near or between Clairemont and Poway.

Long Version:
I get together with a few friends from Clairemont and Poway area about once a month to eat and talk. We found one restaurant where you order at the counter and then seat yourself on a large patio. Because there are no servers, it doesn't feel wrong to stay at the table and talk for a long time. We tip the employees at the counter up front and there is always plenty of space around us for customers coming and going. If you know any restaurants like this in San Diego county, preferably near or between Clairemont and Poway, I would love to know about them! It would be nice to not always go to the same spot.

After I was done at the pharmacy I went to the Starbucks to catch up with her. This is when I learned that she left her wallet somewhere (perhaps in the car, back home, my home).

I heard about other apartments in San Diego having a mold issues so I'm wondering---

Apartment is Eaves in Rancho Penasquitos, San Diego 

She just moved into a new apartment and when she moved in everything seemed fine until she turned on the bathroom vent and left it on for a few hours. She came back to a HUGE amount of debris and dust shooting out of the vent and it sprinkled all over her bathroom.

It's been 2 weeks and now she has been having a constant cough and sore throat, but only when's in her apartment.

Maintenance came in and ""cleaned"" the bathroom vent. Every morning she wakes up with a really sore throat and cough, so she had maintenence check her bedroom HVAC. They said it was just from having the air pointed at her, but since then, no changes and the sore throat and cough is still the same.

She tried leaving the window open and and a humidifier, but the cough and sore throat is STILL bad and only when she runs the HVAC fan or AC. When she leaves the apartment, the sore throat starts going away. 

She put another maintenance request in to check the vents so this is now the 3rd time since she moved in 2 weeks.
I advised having an inspection for mold and possibly seeing a doctor. 

Any legal advice, or medical advice for her?",1,SanDiego

The main ongoing series didn’t quite capture certain landmarks, but comics artist and writer Adam Warren really went above and beyond with a few of his mini-series featuring the characters.

Focusing on the characters Grunge (it was the 90’s!) and Roxy “Freefall” Spaulding, his works utilized his anime-stylings in a few familiar settings.

I remember being shocked when the first issue of the Gen 13 Bootleg Series’ “Grunge The Movie” storyline, had the characters seeing a Hong Kong Film Festival at what appears to be the Mission Valley 20, let alone he captures the nuances of the mall during that time.

Shortly afterwards, Warren’s three-issue “Magical Drama Queen Roxy” showcased a few other familiar locales, such as the Hard Rock Cafe that was located down by the La Jolla Shores, let alone a visit Roxy makes to “The Mall of Doom,” borrows some imagery from ol’ Horton Plaza.  Also of note, the characters go into what appears to be tue Sam Goody at Horton too. I remember, because the one entrance had people stepping down a few steps into the main lower-level area!

1ngayt5,City of San Diego Water/Wastewater Rate Study Snafu,1,1757803357.0,"Fixed monthly fees for utilities are all the rage in the City of San Diego.  Trash/Recycling came first, then SDG&E, and now Water/Wastewater. 

Most utility rate increases and especially fixed fees announcements in the City of San Diego are accompanied by an incantation to the effect of ""we are simply passing along what others are charging us and not making a profit.""  The recent proposed rate adjustment to [Water/Wastewater rates](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/proposition-218-notice.pdf) in no exception.  This approach lets the City off the hook for having its consultants do a defensible study and rate design which passes the Proposition 218 test.

Specifically, not all ""fixed"" charges levied by San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA) should be passed along on the basis of meter size.  It turns out that SDCWA levies only **one** charge (**Infrastructure Access Charge**) that is based on ""meter equivalents"" aka meter size. Others are based on member agencies' long term average water use and should be passed along as volumetric charges.  It can be debated if Customer Service charge should be passed along as a fixed fee.  Not by meter size, but a fixed fee nonetheless. 

The City's faulty Rate Study, as it currently stands, discriminates against property owners who have meter sizes greater than 1"".  As an aside, many meters in the City are 1"" but they connect to a 3/4"" inch pipe on the home side, effectively making the supply a 3/4"" one, blowing up the argument that the household ""could"" use higher amount of water than smaller size meters.  In addition, the Rate Study perpetuates the tiered HCF volumetric rate structure which is already a subject of [lawsuits ](https://bbklaw.com/resources/la-080125-the-price-of-water-just-got-more-complicated-san-diego-s-legal-battle-over-tiered-rates)where the City is so far losing in the Courts.  Not making this up.

While all this requires study of details that are beyond a regular customer's comprehension, high paid consultants doing these studies should be required to do just that.  The City's consultants who did the [2026 Rate Study ](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/fy26-water-rate-study-report.pdf)obviously failed in this regard.  And the City is poised with the argument that if the majority of property owners don't object/protest (they won't), the City Council will rubber stamp what the consultant did.  Predictably, [lawsuits ](https://bbklaw.com/resources/la-080125-the-price-of-water-just-got-more-complicated-san-diego-s-legal-battle-over-tiered-rates)will ensue and the City will waste, and pass along, more fixed charges....

At the very least, the consultants and the City of San Diego could have looked at how a sister agency (Sweetwater Authority of Chula Vista) is passing along the same ""fixed"" charges,  They allocated them on a technically sound study without, I suspect, hiring an expensive consultant to muddy up the waters.  Sweetwater correctly passed the IAC as a fixed meter charge, scaled by the size of the meter, and clearly shows in their rate design how other charges flow to volumetric (per HCF) charges.

I have sent in my protest and written objection in time (the deadline is September 15) and preserved my right to legally challenge this faulty rate adjustment if passed.",1,SanDiego

How to use a roundabout:

Slow down as you approach.

Yield to all traffic already in the roundabout.

Enter heading to the right when there is a big enough gap in traffic to merge safely.

Watch for signs and lane markings that guide you.

Travel in a counter-clockwise direction. Do not stop or pass.

Signal when you change lanes or exit.
If you miss your exit, continue around until you return to your exit.

1ng3vaj,SDCCU has the lowest APR for car loans but …,20,1757785606.0,"I’m car shopping and working with SDCCU has been horrible over this past week. 

First, they took several days just to approve my account, asking me to upload my ID multiple times. After calling and visiting a branch, they realized the issue is that they didn’t accept the card I used to pay the online deposit. 

Then for the loan application, they took several days of me calling to ask about the application status bc the link they sent to track the application status doesn’t work. Every time I call they say it is going to be done that day and it wasn’t.  

Also at the end of the application emails, they state that a member representative is going to contact me once my application is approved but this never happened.

Customer service reps just give incorrect info that I had to research myself because it sounded wrong.

Mission fed and chase approved me within 1-2 days (APR ~ 7.5%). But SDCCU has the lowest rate at around 5.49% but I don’t think with them working like this it’s going to be worth it. Might give Cal Coast a try. ",19,SanDiego
