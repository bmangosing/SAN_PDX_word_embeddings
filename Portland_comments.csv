1nqm9fp,ng7xmxu,">The¬†[last post on the site](https://www.nextportland.com/2023/02/20/under-construction-slabtown-savier-images/)¬†is from 2023, and those two buildings are now built and occupied, so we have plenty to catch up on.I don‚Äôt want it to be another two years until the next article is shared,¬†**so that‚Äôs where you all come in**.

>Over the course of the year, I‚Äôve been working with friends and colleagues to transition¬†*Next Portland*¬†into a nonprofit‚Äîa greater reflection of the community-led impact and attention the site has garnered since the beginning. With the creation of this new organization, the goal is to attract more volunteer effort and collaboration with both public and private sectors. I hope to make the site a collaborative project, dedicated to the longtime mission of making it easier to discover what‚Äôs being built in Portland.

While I like this idea in theory -- it's a generally acknowledged guidelines that 2025 is a bad time to incorporate a brand-new non-profit.

The non-profit funding support right now is DIRE and everyone's scrapping for limited resources. Many financial and tax benefits can occur by partnering with an existing non-profit for fiscal sponsorship while most grants and financial benefits aren't available for non-profits until they've been around for a year or two. (Indeed, a lot of the time it's more practical and reputable to partner with a non-profit with a good reputation before spinning off your own)

I wish them the best because independent reporting on urban development is IMPORTANT. I just wish this blog's two year hiatus returned with more active engagement instead of a heads up that they're spinning up a board of directors.",1,1758844868.0

I cannot run these reports in secure buildings where they work and even if there is a guest wireless network it the bandwidth is an issue as is my double VPN with dual authorization.

I think what the mayor is doing is willfully ignoring homelessness research and favoring solutions that he thinks will ‚Äúclean up the city‚Äù and solutions that are as cheap as possible even if they‚Äôre not very effective for the homeless population.

Most of his decisions for opening night time only shelters seems to be based on this incorrect assumption that most unhoused people have jobs they can go to during the day. EVEN IF that were true, the night time only shelters don‚Äôt even have showers or places to hold your stuff so that seems rather punishing for people who do have day time employment.

I don‚Äôt like the notion that someone coming in doing something is better than nothing - because we weren‚Äôt doing nothing and this actually seems harmful to both housed and unhoused citizens. For example, I‚Äôd be fine living near a 24hr shelter.

Sure, there are bleeding hearts who do literally think this way, but I genuinely believe they are a small minority. I think a TON of the problem is we're sweeping so many issues under a broad umbrella of homelessness which is ultimately just a descriptor of circumstance around one specific essential need. It's not a descriptor of lifestyle or personhood. 

First, you have to look at situational vs chronically homeless. Most of what we stress about is the chronically homeless, and that group can be categorized many different ways and need to be addressed in many different ways. Some of what we look at and think ""drugs"" is severe mental illness that never involved drugs. Some mental illnesses are extraordinarily hard to treat because the sick person does not have the rational mind to actively participate in their own treatment. Some people are severely mentally ill as a direct result of prolonged substance abuse. Some are a bit of both. 

We need to stop talking about homelessness and start focusing on crime because, really, do any of us give a shit where the fent addict causing havoc lays their head down at night? Not all of them are actually homeless. What we care about is what they're up to during the... I'm not sure you can even call it ""waking,"" but let's go with waking hours.

""Wilson has been firm that RVs, even those at permitted safe park sites, shouldn‚Äôt replace a shelter bed or sleeping pod in an outdoor shelter. The city has two designated places were RV owners can park, each accommodating between 50 and 70 vehicles. This month, one of those city-run safe park sites will close after its extended lease on Port of Portland land near the airport ends. Wilson has expressed no interest in replicating that model elsewhere after it closes.""

Oookkkkkk...so even if folks who are living in their own car or RV are essentially now financially prevented from not being unhoused due to this new law from ""I am sooooo for getting houseless folks off the streets that I will make them houseless"" Mayor Wilson:

""[Lived-in vehicles] pose an unacceptable risk to the community,‚Äù Wilson said at an August city council meeting. ‚ÄúWe need to re-establish community standards on public safety and sanitation.‚Äù

And:

""Lacy-Powell panicked three weeks ago when she discovered a green notice stuck to the windshield of each vehicle on a street in Southeast Portland. The city had determined that her vehicles were ‚Äúabandoned,‚Äù according to the note, and would be towing them within 10 days. Without enough money to pay for gas to move both, she quickly moved everything into her RV and drove it to another street. 

Her van was towed, and she said she hasn‚Äôt had the time or transportation to retrieve it. She said she now lives in fear that her remaining vehicle could be towed any time. 

‚ÄúLiving alone as a woman on the street, this isn‚Äôt the life I wanted,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I have one place where I feel safe, my RV. And the city wants to take that away?‚Äù

Mayor Keith Wilson wants to make it easier to do so.

Months ago, Lacy-Powell would have been able to pick up her towed van for free, under a policy that waives towing costs for ‚Äúlived-in‚Äù vehicles retrieved within 30 days. But Wilson reversed that policy last month. Soon, getting her van back would cost more than $300. 

It‚Äôs part of a coordinated effort from the mayor‚Äôs office to crack down on cars and RVs that people are living in that appear inoperable or severely damaged, criteria that meet the city‚Äôs definition of a ‚Äúderelict‚Äù vehicle.""

Mmmm hmmm. Question to all who have read this far, what financial benefit does Multnomah County, the Cities of Portland/Gresham, that are under Mayor Wilson's term in office, have to gain in funding?

One is NOT worse than the other. 

One does not deserve more attention than the other. 

But not every conversation is for every moment.

In this moment, John Lennon‚Äôs quote was a timely and accurate reference to the needs of our community. Save the hand wringing for another moment, when the context calls for it. He was violent man. He also understood, with the parts of himself that were not slaves to his unconscious darkness, that nonviolence was the answer.

John Lennon‚Äôs unmet emotional needs, psychological instability, horrific need for power and control, and inability to regulate his emotional landscape are horrors he inflicted on those he loved. They have every right to name them, to shame his memory, and to seek their own path to justice and healing.  

He deserves to have his memory tainted by these actions and the violence he committed. 

Also‚Äîhis commentary about broader political landscapes, the voice he gave to a movement, and the truth he spoke to power were all vital in his time, and still relevant in ours. Literally all of our ‚Äúheros ‚Äù fall into this same camp. MLK, Harvey Milk, Gandhi‚Ä¶ the list goes on.

Patriarchy corrupts. Our society corrupts. 

Also‚Äîimportant people (with their own rot and corruption) have pointed to the societal problems and systemic injustice and move the needle towards change.

1ns5iff,ngjpd50,"Please recognize that I said ""impactful"" for a reason. I'm well aware that you can find fakes all the time about everything in the news, and that fakes have been around long before AI.

My point is that, so far, fake videos have not been used as primary justification for escalation. The closest we got was whatever happened to Big Balls before the DC invasion, and even that appeared to involve some kind of actual assault even if it was staged, and in general I don't think anybody cared much about it. Fakes do contribute to a general atmosphere of distrust, and they do succeed in firing up the dumbest parts of their base, so they do matter; but for whatever reason, the admin still appears to be looking for a real event. We shouldn't give that to them.

I'm guessing they believe that an actual, undeniable, wounded soldier -- one with family and friends and coworkers, no actors required -- would be a lot more powerful than anything they could generate themselves. And I'm guessing they're surprised that we haven't given them a real one yet. I'm glad we haven't.

I'm not saying to do nothing. Please don't accept this false dilemma of ""violence or capitulation.""

To start, you need an interface where people can upload their images. Trying to deal with this amount of data flowing by on Twitter hashtags will be very difficult. You create a website with a map of Portland where people can submit geotagged footage. 

You take in data from tripcheck cameras and as many security cameras as people will give you access to. Then you ask the public to fill in the gaps by creating footage of their own. You can also get overhead footage by flying a ton of planes (expensive) or getting satellite images (every location on earth pretty much gets scanned by satellites at least once a day. But not all the satellites scan at a high enough resolution for your purposes). To show the lack of fires (generally associated with mass riots), there are satellites that can detect heat and you can use purpleair sensors for air quality.

Edit: obviously, not all potential congregating spaces in the city are near streets. However, many of them are, and it‚Äôs an easy calculation to do. So,
[The city estimates that it has 2100 miles of streets.](https://www.portland.gov/transportation/vision-zero/speed-limits)
The average person probably isn‚Äôt willing to walk, especially while filming, for more than a couple hours a day. A fit person can walk at 3 mph, meaning in two hours of walking they could cover six miles. 2100/6 is 350. Thus, you would need about 350 people walking at the specified duration and speed to film all Portland‚Äôs streets. Figuring out the optimal routing for those 350 people is another issue, and you would want a powerful computer to solve that problem most effectively.",1,1759030902.0

1ns1ite,ngizuf7,"I‚Äôve lived here my whole life (40+ years), and honestly 99% of the stuff you see online about Portland is made up bullshit. All those riots you saw during BLM? That all happened within a few square city blocks at night. The overwhelming majority of people never even saw any sort of evidence of it unless they watched the news or went to check it out themselves. Somewhere I have video I took during the height of it where I started at the Justice Center (the epicenter of the protests) and walked along every street in each direction. Within two or three blocks it looked perfectly normal. 

We have slightly higher property crime here than in some other cities, but lower violent crime. We got a spike in 2020 to go along with COVID, but so did everywhere else in the country. We didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdefund the police,‚Äù they just got 2% less than they asked for one year ‚Äî in which every single area of the state‚Äôs budget took a cut, and theirs was actually one of the lowest ‚Äî but the Portland Police Union used it to gaslight people by telling them that they couldn‚Äôt do their jobs because their funding was cut. It was a political move by a corrupt union to try to punish city leadership for trying to make them accountable. I‚Äôve lived in a fairly crime-heavy area for the last decade or so, and the most I‚Äôve ever had happen was someone popped my car door open to steal some change. Some areas are worse than others, and it‚Äôs often the areas that tourists frequent because they‚Äôre easy targets. 

The fentanyl crisis hit us especially hard. We were always the heroin capital of the US so it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising, but a lot of people came here because we have better services available and are generally more tolerant on drug policy. There was an attempt to decriminalize drugs to treat them as a medical issue instead of a criminal one, but it failed due to mismanagement and the fact that it just led to more people coming here to do drugs. Once again the Police Union used it as a way to gaslight people and say that they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it even though there was literally existing laws on the books that they could enforce, if they chose to. 

There have been some protests happening at the ICE facility (usually 20 - 50 people and not even that bad), but the city recently issued a land use violation to ICE because it came out that they were holding people there for too long and breaking the law themselves. 

Downtown has struggled a little since COVID for various reasons, but it‚Äôs come a long way. Sure, there‚Äôs parts of downtown with a lot of homeless people (the same ones that always have been sketchy for as long as I‚Äôve been alive), but for the most part it‚Äôs  just a city with regular city problems. Cops can and will go anywhere they want, and honestly as an able-bodied man I can only think of a few little corners of town that I wouldn‚Äôt feel totally safe walking alone in at night. Even with those ones I would do it, I‚Äôd just keep my wits about me a little more. 

One great thing about Portland is that we have an *amazing* PBS station here. OPB does some great reporting and is probably the closest thing I can think of to an unbiased view of the city. Nigel Jaquiss at the Willamette Week (one of our local alt-weeklies) does some really great reporting, as does Noelle Crombie at the Oregonian.

1ns1ite,ngjz9e8,"It's because Portlanders are actively holding an ongoing protest at the ICE facility there. Portland is an extremely left leaning city with a history of effective activist action stretching back decades. It also has a reputation for being one of the weirder cities on the block, which I think makes it an appealing target to them, maybe less likely to have sympathy from other areas of the nation. Ron Wyden is the senator from OR who has been a thorn in Trump's side. Those are my guesses why he's sending them there.

Portland and the whole PNW is extremely safe, there are no neighborhoods so beseiged by crime anywhere over here that cops won't go. Even the areas some local people cry about being ""so bad, so crime ridden"" are because those people have been so sheltered to never have lived in cities like you're describing that visibly homeless people existing freaks them out. Like I'm from Portland and live in a neighboring city and visit Portland regularly. I shop and dine and walk around downtown and on the east side regularly. I have never had an issue. One of my kids lives in Portland and walks and busses everywhere. She's tiny and young and never had an issue. Anyone who tells you it's riddled with crime, if they truly believe it, is EXTREMELY sheltered. Or they're lying to you.

Edited to add because I wanted to dive a little deeper if you're not familiar with Portland. Having grown up in the 90s in Portland I did not realise that a good deal of our country, if not the majority, did not recycle, had serious problems with gay people, didn't have ready access to organic food, did not have walkable access to public greenspaces basically anywhere they want to live, didn't have robust art and music programs in their public schools, and didn't give a fuck about the environment.

\- Complete misuse of the military and a total disrespect to those that serve. I don't expect a guy who dodged the draft to know the real meaning of ""war-ravaged"".

\- I think nothing will come of this unless we feed into the trap. Portland is categorically safer than most large cities in the country - This is a total blunder on his part, and he will not get the reaction he wants.

\- While I don't trust ICE to show restraint and tact in this moment, I assure you the members of the military are absolutely not on board with using force against Americans. There are far too many links in the chain for this to happen without resistance and condemnation from within. It goes against every notion of serving your country. The US military is much more diverse than you might think.

\- Progressives (myself included) need to get better about co-opting patriotism. We seemed to have ceded that right to MAGA and we allow them to wrap themselves in American Flag clown costumes and spout a bunch of bullshit one-liners about the declaration of independence while they actively cheer on the dismantling of our rights and liberties. I'm being serious - Quit doing shit like burning the flag, no more ""America is evil"" style chants, form better arguments than ""abolish prisons"" and quit using contested buzzwords like ""capitalism"" and ""patriarchy"". I get the sentiment, but I'm sick of losing to such cheap tricks. These acts of resistance are a total bungling of optics, and in turn seem to hand-feed FOX News and the MAGA apparatus the quick arousing clips they need to fuel their propaganda machine. Why do they get to cosplay as patriots? We do we so easily allow them to paint us as ""anti-American""? We're getting severely owned on this front.

\- Look after your neighbors. If you know someone that disagrees with you on politics, I urge you to show compassion and try to connect with their concerns. Voice your love for this country, the progress we've made, and the potential we have to thrive. Don't give up on the American experiment because it isn't utopia now. Let's continue the work and not encourage the undoing of progress.

\- Vote. Vote like its chess. Encourage voting. Your voice and your vote matters. The discourse you engage in online matters. Avoid hyperbole. Get your feelings out of this. It's too late to sit on moral high ground. Democrats/progressives will never be good enough on every issue you care about, I get it, but we need to stop being single issue non-voters and throwing our votes away on third-party candidates or encouraging political apathy and sitting out elections.",220,1759077696.0

I am deeply worried that the history of friction between Portland residents and authoritarian mistreatment from the federal government  will give this regime the Flashpoint that they seek so badly to fully institute a violent and armed takeover of states, who are vocal and unwilling to fall in line with its playback.

Anyone who took an oath to defend and protect our nation and the peoples of this nation has a duty to stand up against this aggression and to stop the violence against unarmed civilians. The one thing I have not seen enough of is the walls of veterans standing between ICE agents and the protesters, ensuring that the people still get their chance to use their voices and the agitators have a deterant from attacking civilains.

We all feel isolated by the events that have happened in our country, but the only way to win against this aggression is to join together as a community and show that we are united against their specific variety of hatred.

1nsrybw,ngo65qf,"This is something I posted to Facebook last night. I'm sharing it here because the outrage I'm feeling is beyond extreme. I've felt the same outrage since 2016, but I've finally reached my breaking point. 

This is a long post, and the kind I always preface by pointing out I don‚Äôt post much of this kind of thing. I understand its futility. We have long surpassed the age of reason. Few will find this enlightening or educational. Your mind will not be changed. I‚Äôm just screaming into the void and preaching to the choir. But I have to get it out of me, because it‚Äôs the only way to keep the madness at bay, and there‚Äôs plenty of that to go around these days. 

I spent close to ten years living in Portland, Oregon. I moved away in January of this year, but plan on returning in the next few months after I settle in with my new job. I enjoyed living there. It‚Äôs big enough that there‚Äôs plenty to do, but small enough I don‚Äôt need to own a car. I‚Äôve jokingly called it ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Least Favorite City‚Äù (folks from the mid-west LOVE that line. I told it at a bar in Vegas a number of years ago and thought everyone would die from a collective aneurism of laughter), and the reputation isn‚Äôt entirely undeserved. For the most part, it‚Äôs a fairly welcoming place where the biggest source of contention might be how early you have to line up for a trendy breakfast spot, or fighting over kale at the supermarket when a single snowflake appears in the forecast. We‚Äôve got a guy who rides a unicycle and wears a Darth Vader helmet while playing flaming bagpipes. Drag queens read to children after school. Parking cones have become an unofficial mascot on the local sub-Reddit. You can‚Äôt throw a rock without hitting a marijuana dispensary, and at times, supply has outweighed demand so severely some places can‚Äôt even give it away. The arts scene can run the gamut from inspirational and engaging to laughably pretentious and ridiculous. Every band probably has an IPA named after them. Several election cycles ago, one local candidate referred to the poor as ‚Äúeconomic refugees‚Äù and my eyes rolled so hard I thought they‚Äôd fall out of my head. 

And yes, it has a lot of faults. The city isn‚Äôt equipped to deal with the population increase in the last two decades. Rents are obscene. Property crimes are rampant. I don‚Äôt know a single Prius owner who hasn‚Äôt had their catalytic converter ripped off at least twice. Many retailers are forced to lock a ridiculous number of products behind the counter. Hard drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine are everywhere and have ruined so many lives. Recently passed laws decriminalizing possession of small amounts are ineffective - why anyone thought they would help is a mystery - and there‚Äôs been talk of walking them back. Homelessness and mental health are major issues that subjectively seem to have no workable solutions. 

But one thing that city is not, is a war zone. 

This bears repeating: at no point has the city of Portland, Oregon been overrun by anarchists, or domestic terrorists. It is not lawless. It is not on fire. It is not like living in hell, by any stretch of the imagination. George Soros isn‚Äôt funding civil disobedience. The events that make the news - such as the election and George Floyd protests - were contained to about two to three city blocks. And from those I know who attended, the violence was perpetrated by a small handful of agitators who were deliberately trying to rile up an otherwise peaceful crowd so the police could shut the situation down. And now the National Guard will soon be rolling in, ‚Äú[with] Full Force, if necessary‚Äù simply because a fucking unhinged lunatic is calling all the shots. 

Growing up close to a major army base, I‚Äôm used to seeing military transports going up and down the freeway. It‚Äôs nothing new. But to think that sometime in the not too distant future, I might look out the window of my home and see them rolling through a neighborhood doesn‚Äôt sit well with me, particularly when there is zero cause aside from a massively overblown ego. After all, I‚Äôve spent the last fifty years believing that an authoritarian regime would never take hold here. That only happens in other countries, right? Banana republics, and the like. 

But what really drives this issue, what really turns the madness volume to eleven, is when I think of people like my late father, or my step father, a career naval officer and combat infantryman, respectively. When I think about an uncle who fought the Nazis, or a grandfather who parachuted into the Philippines. When I think of other relatives, and friends, and neighbors, and millions of others who swore an oath to ‚Äúsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic‚Äù. I took that oath myself. Though I was a mere eighteen years old and tremendously immature even for that age, I understood what it meant. I took it seriously. It held weight. Still does. 

Now all of that is being subverted. It‚Äôs meaningless. We took that oath and promised - and in many cases gave - our lives for the belief that in doing so, all of us would remain free. Certainly this is a far from perfect country and society but the promise of freedom and unity has been the driving force since day one. Without that promise, even if it‚Äôs just a delusion, then what do we have left? 

And as I mentioned in the beginning, we are past the age of reason. Those days are over. We‚Äôre wired differently now, and for so many of us, it‚Äôs about survival. Nothing more. What‚Äôs ahead of us is much of the same, and even worse. There is next to no chance that help will arrive to save us. If it does, it‚Äôs going to come as an event so catastrophic that it defies logic. I keep thinking of Watchmen and Adrian Veidt. Maybe he had it right. If you are still under the delusion that things are going to get better under this administration, then you are beyond help.",32,1759076171.0

Thank you. You are not alone in this. My father served two tours as a combat medic in Vietnam - volunteered because Kennedy asked what he could do for his country. My grandfather was Airborne and parachuted into France at the start of the Normandy invasion. Heck, my paternal ancestors fought for Boston in 1775-76 and died on Bunker Hill. While I didn't serve (my father did NOT want me to after his experience), I have always had the utmost respect for those who put country before self and it stings to think of the choices that current enlisted and officers are facing.

My father was one of the most compassionate human beings in the world. He only hated two people in this world - Charles Manson (I was the same ""age"" as Sharon Tate's child, so it hit him pretty hard when the murders happened) and Donald Trump. Of Trump, my father used to speak of him as the worst specimen to ever call themselves American  - his utter failures as a businessman, his total disrespect for people, his greed and his gaudy tastes among many other ""traits"". 

My father died in 2011 - long before Trump entered the political arena. When the demagogue was elected in 2016, I was actually thankful that my father was gone. As I would morosely joke with my friends, ""I'm glad my father is dead because Trump as President would surely have killed him.""

1nsg7a2,ngnrysz,"So I‚Äôm from Kansas City and may be talking out of line here, but I think it‚Äôs important to understand what OP is likely implying. I agree with the prevailing sentiment on your sub that Portland needs to remain peaceful and not provoke a response from federal or national guard troops over the coming weeks. Optics are important. But they‚Äôre important for showing why this administration‚Äôs goals are authoritarian in nature, to show that Trump is a tyrant intentionally trying to provoke violence. The problem is, once enough cities ignore these probing attempts, this administration won‚Äôt just give up on their plans. They won‚Äôt be beat by passivity, they‚Äôre only going to pivot to a new strategy. Sooner or later they will do whatever they can to drag more and more people off to camps to disappear them.

At a certain point we can not depend on passive resistance anymore. Obviously there‚Äôs steps along the way until we get to the most dire levels of resistance, and the next steps should be mass general strikes and direct action that don‚Äôt depend on mass political violence. But eventually the administration will use their monopoly of violence to attack those who strike and dissent. 

Eventually we will need to have an understanding of 21st century asymmetrical you-know-what tactics. There is no greater force multiplier for that than drones. Plenty of current conflicts around the globe have shown their use for any side fighting a significantly larger foe. There is no larger foe likely than the US military.

1ntm6vc,nguyjmn,"Hi there, I work at the Visitor Center (1132 SW Harvey Milk St.) in downtown Portland and can help you with some family-friendly suggestions. We've already compiled some ideas on [this page](https://www.travelportland.com/attractions/kid-friendly-activities/) on our website, if you want to start there.

For little ones or elementary school-aged kids, I'd recommend:

* [The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry](https://omsi.edu/) (OMSI) has spaces geared for younger ages, but is fun for the whole family too.
* Mike Bennet's [Wonderwood Springs Mini Golf](https://www.wonderwoodsprings.com/) is a unique experience where you can play, eat, and quest in his imaginative world. 
* [PlayDate PDX ](https://playdatepdx.com/)is an indoor jungle gym and playspace that is good for a rainy day activity. 

For older ages, I like:

* [Hopscotch](https://letshopscotch.com/locations/portland), which has already been mentioned, is an interactive museum that fuses art and play into each exhibit.
* [Washington Park](https://explorewashingtonpark.org/) is home to many attractions, including the Oregon Zoo, and has great hiking trails and free gardens to explore.
* An all ages arcade in SE Portland called [Wunderland Avalon](https://wunderlandgames.com/) is a great spot to play some games or catch a movie with the family. 

You are welcome to stop by the Visitor Center for even more suggestions and free stickers! We are open daily from 9am to 5pm. I hope you have a good time together during their visit!

Caution: the first few minutes of each show sometimes has somewhat oddball things, before they start interviewing the guest, so if it starts out sounding odd then you might just let the first few minutes slide until the interview starts.

You don't need to sign in or sign up or pay anything to listen to that. Their website seems a little slow to start, so give it the needed clicks or taps and then wait a bit to see if the little icon starts spinning to let you know that you will hear the program in a moment. If it starts pushing you to install their app then tap on the three dots in the upper right corner of your phone and see if you can find and tap on ""Use Desktop Mode"" to fool it into thinking you have an antique desktop computer and that will make it stop trying to get you to install their app.",7,1759164553.0

1ntl27t,ngvq7zo,"That makes sense, and I'm definitely not trying to insert myself/opine on your personal relationship with your relatives. But in general, I think it's completely wild to cut your relatives off because they voted for Trump. My parents are hardcore Republicans and they both voted for Trump and I'm as far left as you can imagine but we just make fun of each other and don't take it too seriously because we know that both of the major parties are completely out of control and controlled by greed/corporations. We find common ground/accept each other despite our political disagreements. Maybe sometimes we have a heated conversation (usually surrounding immigration issues) but I feel like keeping your close relationships is far more important than cutting them off based on something no one can control or fully understand. People are so quick to cut off people who care about them for politicians that don't. Tribalism is a poison.

Also, this isn't totally relevant, but how many Trump voters/Republicans have you heard of cutting off their liberal relatives? You don't hear about it that much. It's usually always the libs that cut off the right. Why is that?",0,1759174035.0

I am outwardly a very ‚Äònormal‚Äô person (2 dogs, marriage, house, stable job etc) so usually our differences aren‚Äôt really a problem as long as I don‚Äôt get baited into any political discussions. I have never come out to them as a bisexual person or an atheist because I am really really worried about their reactions. They know I voted dem but I try not to let on how much their racism and homophobia disgusts me. They live far away from me now and it helps because I now have friends who know and appreciate me for who I am, but most of my friends have supportive and understanding families so I think it‚Äôs hard for them to understand how painful it can be.

They are big Christians though and have strong feelings about abortion, and living in Texas they have strong opinions about immigration as well.

1nt8y39,ngrzjbx,"Happy to help you! The first few weeks are going to be stressful for both of you. Can you take some time off? Welcoming a new friend home and then leaving for 9+ hrs per day is not going to work.


Patience. Let the dog be for a bit. Feed, walk, etc. Patios should never be used for bathroom. You need to take the pup out morning, lunch, after work, and bed time. Accidents are common which is why you need to go out more than normal. Get treats and make a big deal for outside potties. Again, your patio is not for that. Also, you cannot leave a dog unattended out there when you're at work.


Creating a routine is key. Love is routine. You need time. Take some days off and start a routine pronto. Doggie daycare may not make sense anytime soon.",11,1759120922.0

Around him slow all your movements down. Move in ways his eyes can see, like try not to walk behind him or just reach down to take his collar or leash off, touch under his chin then top of head then slide hand to the collar area. 

High value treats (cheese, boiled ground beef, cut up pieces of steak) and act like you're a drug dealer where the first one or two is free. Then just sit down on the couch with some more in your hand/lap and see if he'll come over for more. Soft praise if he does.

Soft praise for *anything* he does that you like.

And just give it time so he can learn you, you can learn him and build trust.

I‚Äôd contact the Oregon Humane Society. They have behavioral specialists, assessments, training for exactly this. 

From there you‚Äôll know what your dog needs. You didn‚Äôt tell us if your dog gets along with other dogs? Often a skittish rescue really relaxes, opens up, learns to be a more confident dog if they find their ‚Äúpack‚Äù, or it can be the opposite and they are fearful.

I had that same situation with my dog and she absolutely hated her crate and I got rid of it, and she is the happiest, non-destructive dog who has the roam of the house. As for teaching him where to go potty, you can buy a spray at Petsmart that has the scent of PP and you spray it where you want him to go. That way, he gets the message loud and clear. And ask for treats, I would not even force him to take it out of your hand. I would just put it down on a plate on the floor and move away. Slowly, but surely you can move the plate closer and closer to where you sit overtime and that will acclimate him gradually to accepting the treat from you without fear.",1,1759155436.0

Be gentle, and give the dog his own small space with pee pads (like a bedroom or bathroom) and restrict them to a smaller space while they adjust. For at least 3 days. 

Take them out every hour or two for an opportunity to pee and praise elaborately when they go outside. Give treats upon return to indoors. Repeat. Be consistent. For at least 3 weeks.",13,1759121225.0

However, I‚Äôve noticed he definitely gets nervous on walks so I will for sure be avoiding doggie daycare for at least 3 months/if he seems to be more social and likes being around other dogs.

I do have a large pen for him and will keep the crate in there as well as pee pads.

Helps him connect the dots that's what you want. Do this several times if needed.

If you don't let your dog sleep in bed with you what's the point! (Kidding) If he has night accidents, crate him. If you're okay sleeping in bed with him, nothing wrong with that. I love sleeping with my dog in my bed. Or you could get him a little dog bed that you put on your bed that maybe he'll sleep in and then move his bed off your bed see if he'll keep sleeping there. My dogs always loved having their own dog beds but I also let them sleep in my bed if they wanted. My dog I have now likes having a crate or spot set up under my bed if he wants alone time.

You‚Äôd be surprised how many just let their dogs do this and act like it is not big deal. 

In my opinion it is good for bad owners to see that their dog could get taken if they do not shape up. 

It is not that the dispatchers do not have empathy it is just not their first time what so ever. I cannot even imagine how many of these calls they are getting a day. 

It has been really bad this summer. The stories I could tell. 

Given my odds of running into loose dogs the amount of calls they are getting like this must be high. It has been extra crazy this past week. I am still worked up over it all. 

Two days ago I had to slam on my breaks to avoid absolutely destroying an Aussie loose in the intersection of 122nd and Glisan which is a high crazy zone. 

It was running from an aggressive pit bull at East Holladay Park. 

Four days ago I followed a tiny Chihuahua wandering in and out of burnside right to its apartment door which was opened!!! I yelled at the owner (while on the phone with animal control) for just letting it take itself for a walk on a busy road like that. The owner could care less. I told the officers where she lived in case of future calls. 

Six days ago I ran into an elderly lab that had taken himself for a walk to Playhaven park, and would start play zooming around anytime anyone tried to grab him. 

First time seeing that. It was so cute. 

I could not blame that owner as much you could tell he was a lil stinker. The owner showed up just before the officers did. They live off of Foster. The dog wandered quite far. 

The owner did tell me though that animal control is quite upset at them over this repeated issue. I was not surprised. 

Most of the time the owner shows up before the officers do. Then I get to scold the owner. 

They act like no one has ever called them out on their bs. Maybe that is the problem? People need to call others out more. 

The officers want the dogs reunited with their owners and the officers love dogs so much in my experience.

I am sure they have a database that tracks the bad owners that they repeatedly get calls for. For that reason they always need to be always in the loop in my opinion which is why I call them to handle it. 

Same goes for any dog that shows ANY sign of aggression. I am friggin on it no matter where I am. I called while on vacation at Laguna Beach. 

I never take a break. 

Doberman lunged at my bf. My bf tried to stop me from calling. Elderly couple could barely hold onto him. So yeah best believe I told my bf hell no I am calling. 

Officers were there within seconds! I could tell they have a lot of issues there based on that quick response. 

First thing I do is take a photo of their license plate if possible or get an idea of where they live, and then I call animal control immediately. 

I am done playing with bad dog owners. The dispatchers know me very well at this point. 

If I can manage my insane beasts these people should be able to handle their lil Chihuahua. I have two cattle dogs. One with three cattle breeds in him. 

Maybe I should train my boy with three breeds (Aussie, collie, heeler) to herd these dogs back home hah? 

He chases kitties up trees no problem. 

Tops out at 30 mph on mtn bike trails with us. Jumps higher than 5 ft from standstill, and can clear massive gap jumps on the trail no problem. Goes from 0 to 100 within milliseconds regardless of what time of day or night. 

He would scare every single dog right home. 

So ridiculous at this point. If everyone wants to let their dogs run free I guess I will start doing the same and train mine to chase your‚Äôs home. 

Dogs must be leashed in the entire city of Portland except for the designated areas. People are risking it with those officers when they let them off leash on the city streets. 

Their officers have the ability to take your dog from you, work with law enforcement, and have license plate readers to issue you fines. 

Animal control just hired a bunch more officers as well because of this growing issue, and the growing issue of violent dogs. 

If the bad owners all thought they were getting off easy before.. just know that is changing. COVID created a lot of terrible dog owners. 

People like me are on it. I hope they keep testing it though. It will just mean they will keep hiring more officers. 

That is why the city hired on more Park Rangers as well I am sure. 

I am SHOCKED at how many people will not call animal control when a dog is aggressive toward them. 

It is getting really bad. 

They will tell me when I ask if they called‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúOh they were just feeling protective over their space.. blah blah blah.‚Äù Same answer every time. 

And we wonder why these issues just keep growing? I would be terrified raising a child in this city at this point. 


By the way I am pretty sure the officers are not going to immediately take the aggressive dog. 

It is a case by case basis I am sure. 

If it is not a highly dangerous situation I believe they will require the owner to muzzle the dog and get it into their database in case any more issues arise with that dog. 

I now carry pepper spray and am ready to spray a line on the ground in front of me if any dog charges towards me. 

I am extremely protective over ever child in this city right now given what I have seen what bad dog owners are willing to do, and how little they care about anyone around them besides their precious dog

Idk what it is but I‚Äôm pretty annoyed at America these days. It‚Äôs like the one thing you can count in, management to stifle progress. 

You probably have some middle managers getting paid a good amount, and refusing to value the lower level employees who actually run the store. Middle management has meetings about it, luncheons, invite their friends consulting groups over for meetings and lunch, etc. 

It‚Äôs the same thing for why homelessness will never be solved. I saw an ad for one of the admin assistants and the salary was something like 162k per year. If that is admin think about the person they work for. 

If they solve the problems, then their job is not needed any more. 

So they give out a few tents. Never really solving the issue. 

At Sheridans, the people who are paid to solve the issues maybe don‚Äôt, bc if they did, then the problem would be solved and they couldn‚Äôt milk their salary anymore. 

The store is small enough that it is actually shocking that the retail employees are in the dark about what is going on. You would think that word would be difficult to keep quiet , but apparently the wall between retail staff and management is baked in good, which is probably exactly what management wants. And when the company finally goes under, they will get severance, payout, unemployment etc. 

The shelves being empty says a lot in my opinion. They are not even trying to save the store. I hate this management culture that just always makes the worst decisions for the company, at every turn, and that is about the one consistently accurate thing.

A fair warning: this is a shared space woth other patients. There is also a high staff to patient ratio as well with staff members, nurses, and psych techs stationed around the room for support. This area is locked, so if you are there voluntarily, someone will have to escort you out (ie you wont be able to just walk out, this part freaks people put sometimes so its good to know ahead of time).  

 Sometimes, people are admitted to the inpatient unit for further treatment and stabilization, and that is more like a regular hospital with beds and stuff. Whatever the case is, they will set you up with aftercare and treatment resources. Good luck! Put yourself first and stay the course!! you got this!",10,1759102227.0

I may or may not read responses to this, so if you need to attempt to wind me up with trolling, its your waste of time.
Also, for the sarcasm or humour impaired, yes, i quite realize ""president"" biden has zero chance of being elected to anything. 
It would be as if i said that it would be as likrly as "" doctor"" Biden being made surgeon general......and having Doctor Pepper and Doctor Demento as her assistants.  
One final thought.....ive yet to meet anyone who claims ""membership "" in antifa and find the description of antifa itself to be a bit of a stand in for those with no nuance that are unaware that anti racist groups predated antifa in the states by decades and i cant imagine anyone (for obvious reasons) insisting on being recognised as part of any group. 
Id be very suspicious of anyone who asks about antifa or who wants to give the press a ""exclusive"" about antifa.
As far as i personally know, protests are a gathering of similarly minded persons who loathe racism and have concerns about fascist rhetoric being used by those in office.

I‚Äôm starting to realize how bad she‚Äôs hurting me though by her actions around my family members passing away.  On my absolute worst day I had mentally after my sister died, I had text her a couple apartments away and asked if I could come by to get a hug from her.  She said no.  She didn‚Äôt want her kids around a ‚Äúsad me‚Äù.  All I wanted in that moment was connection man.  So I cried myself to sleep with a 9 on my night stand and I locked my apartment and bedroom door and was passed out hard.  She came over while I was sleeping and got in saw the 9 on my night stand almost called to put me in a 72 hour hold even though I have no phsyc history.  She chose then out of that to stop being in my life for 2 weeks because of it.  Almost like she was just avoiding me.  Then my mom‚Äôs stuff just happened I flew out to NC with my son and my wife came a day later.  While out there one day my mom was having a hard time hearing and slurring her words completely. I thought she was going to die man.  The next morning my wife decided after all of that that we could celebrate a birthday for my mom since she may not make it to her next one.  I thought wow what an amazing idea.  Well my wife decided to sleep all day so I called my step dad to pick me up and he came and got me for like 5 hours we came back my sister in law and her didn‚Äôt care to come meet up with my mom and I.  But that‚Äôs what we were there for.  I took my mom all over a lake on kayak while she kept like falling in and out of sleep.  I thought she may lose her life while on the kayak and was having a hard time worrying about it.  My step dad drops me off at my sisters house and my wife and sister decide then it was time to go grab dinner and get my moms stuff for her birthday surprise.  Well I gave them my debit card and they left for 3 hours while I had already prepped the bbq and had it running for a couple hours.  To find out they spent almost $500 on groceries on my debit card even though I was just there for the weekend.  My wife wanted to get down and dirty the next night before her flight home in the morning.  I had my dead brother and sister in my mind and was no where near the mood for that.  I asked if she would just cuddle up so I could sleep.  She blew up on me in the middle of the night we stayed up all night.  I was supposed to take her to the airport so she could fly back to Portland and she then chose to order a fucking uber to the airport.  I felt like she completely turned her back on me.

I started my own business 18 years ago and the person who supported me the most - more than my parents, sibling, even my closest friends - was my brand new boyfriend at the time (still my partner and #1 supporter). 

Looking back I don't know if I would have had the courage to do it without his support and encouragement. Starting my business was one of the hardest things I've ever done but also one of the most important, besides picking him as my partner!

I now resent how little support I received from others - a friend: ""oh, you're still doing that?!"", another friend handed me back my new business card saying ""I don't need this"", my brother didn't even bother to read my 1 page business plan when I asked him to...

1n7n4rs,ncvnlpq,"As someone who moved to the PNW from across the country a few years ago, my recommendation is to not move to Portland. When you are visiting take a little stroll across the State line and check out Vancouver. It's beautiful, much safer and way less ghetto. WA has no state taxes which means you get a much larger paycheck at the end of the day assuming you also work in Washington. You'll be double taxed (sales and state) if you work in Washington and live in Oregon though, so definitely don't do that! My understanding is they also have an additional city tax that the other areas do not have, so it has a higher cost of living as well. Portland has gone downhill dramatically and is overrun by addicts and unhoused folks. The best bet these days is to live and work in a safer area and then party and shop in Portland. That way you avoid the sales taxes and the majority of the crack/meth/fentanyl/heroin/pillheads. There are plenty of areas like you described in Vancouver which is a only a bridge away and nearly a different planet by comparison. It's truly sad what the city has become, in my opinion.

Honestly OR DOR should handle the metro, Portland, and Multnomah filings. The base data is from the OR tax returns. They just need some extra apportionment information for businesses. It would make it so much easier for so many individuals and businesses.

Instead they choose not to work with each other which increases the burden on individuals and businesses. It‚Äôs not an impossible task. They just don‚Äôt want to do it despite all of the efficiencies that would come from consolidating the returns on one dept. that has trained tax professionals. 

In my experience OR DOR has great staff who are incredibly helpful and know what they are talking about. When you call they answer and can resolve 99% of questions. 

When you call the City of Portland the person who answers doesn‚Äôt know anything beyond basic information. They have to escalate any real issue to someone who you don‚Äôt get to talk to directly. So if the first person misunderstands your issue and doesn‚Äôt communicate it correctly to the expert, it won‚Äôt be resolved. I‚Äôve gone in circles with them so many times because they don‚Äôt put the resources into properly training their staff. 

The lack of service from the City of Portland matches all of the other departments I have worked with. Good luck getting questions answered about permitting or programs the city offers.

1mv5z1a,n9xxae1,"What are you talking about - ""thriving in a place where he learns and feels safe."" While I hope all elementary school kids feel ""safe"", they most certainly are not thriving in Oregon and especially Portland. Oregon is ranked 49th in 8th-grade reading on the Nation's Report Card, and some analyses even place the state last in 4th-grade reading and math, adjusted for demographics.

The teacher's union recently went on strike, claiming they wanted smaller class sizes for kids, but ended up settling for teacher pay raises and more time off for curriculum planning (which means even less class time for kids). Our school year is one of the shortest in the entire country, which directly correlates to test scores and success in college. We have high truancy rates for kids, and crazily - high absentee rates for teachers. Here are some facts about our short school year:

   * 172 instructional days in FY2005-06, which was shorter than the 180 days required by over 35 other states.
   * Portland's mandated instructional hours for elementary students are about 900, compared to a national average of 975 for elementary students, according to an analysis of 2020 data by an education advocacy nonprofit.
* **Comparison to Other Cities/States:**
   * Many states, including Washington, require 1,080 hours of instruction at the high school level, compared to Oregon's 990 hours.

And yet Portlanders just passed a new tax to update 3 schools at the cost of almost $500 million per school, making them the most expensive schools in the country. We're spending a lot of money to pay teachers to work some of the shortest school years in the country, while our kids have some of the lowest achievement rates in the country.

1ml44p0,n7zal63,"Katrina survivor here. We landed here after losing everything and found out about The Big One a month into our new life here.  This was before anyone knew much about it.  I have studied this very carefully, to say the least.

1) NO the feds will not be there, hands outstretched with money. Watch some Katrina documentaries to see for yourself.  Katrina will look like a cake walk compared to a possibly 700 mile x 150 mile regional disaster (the entire PacNW) in which NOBODY can leave ahead of time  (vs 90% of Louisianans who got out of harm‚Äôs way).

2) we got an EQ rider via State Farm when we bought a home here and will never insure without one. We did strap the foundation to the house.  It took us 6 years to be able to buy a home similar to the once we had in New in Orleans due to government and disaster red tape. Getting everything straightened out was a part-time job for years.

3) we were heavily insured in Katrina ‚Äî State Farm paid us full policy value (flood and homeowners) before they could even access the destroyed house (it still had water in it 6 weeks later due to 2nd hurricane). I had videoed every surface, drawer, closet, fence, shed, etc of the home, evacuated with an external hard drive, and sent the video and a spreadsheet of losses I made off the video once we got stabilized in an interim location.  State Farm sent us two full policy checks no questions asked.  This was HUGE for us to feel some sense of security when we lost everything else ‚Äî home, school, jobs, city, and had no idea where to turn.  We were still ‚Äúup in the air‚Äù a year after.

4) when disaster strikes the first thing you want to know is who is alive. And you won‚Äôt know for weeks, maybe months and this is ALL you will think about.  So IMO the most important thing you can do is make as many prep and aftermath plans as you can now:

* learn where the Portland BEECNS are and choose which one in each quadrant of the city you frequent that you will meet up at, with anybody you care about and would suffer not knowing if they are alive. Do NET or CERT training.

* get your documents AND PHOTOS into the cloud and have ppl outside the zone in the loop on your plans and documents.  All I could think of once I knew my people were alive were my photos. I lost the most important ones on my walls and in drawers.  Providence saved the 90% that happened to be stored high in a closet with shelves that did not collapse (luck, not planning).

* don‚Äôt just prep at home.  You perish in this order: exposure, water, food.  Prep for exposure water and food in your car, on transit, at work.  I keep my car tank 3/4 full always.  If this happens, as soon as the roads are ready (which may take 6 or more weeks) I‚Äôll be ready to get past the Cascade Range and refill en route to Boise or wherever.


There is so much to do.  Prep is a way of life, not a destination.  It‚Äôs a way to think and be.  Financial prep is part of it.  There are many sites that can help ‚Äî just get started one step at a time.  Start with your transportation. 

Blessings, good luck!  Good on you for asking!  I‚Äôm happy to correspond with anyone about this.  I hosted a prep club in my neighborhood for years.  I find people want to talk and learn,  but it is hard for them to take action.  Start with simple steps like putting water in your car and making a reminder to rotate it out.  

Fear is a powerful motivator.  The irony is that prepping reduces fear, each action reduces it a bit more, but you have to have enough fear to get started.  Kinda like losing weight :)   A stroke or heart attack will get you moving and dieting if nothing did before  

Had I never been hit by a hurricane I also would not be prepping now.  We were prepared in Louisiana because we had many close calls and got practice each time before Katrina.  We don‚Äôt have that here as we are a silent EQ zone.  Much harder.",1,1754850229.0

1mho4jz,n6xxral,"If I had a friend coming for a visit, I‚Äôd suggest that they stay here at the Inn at Northrup Station. They have a small parking lot if you rent a car, but you don‚Äôt need one unless you‚Äôre going out of the city. Down 21st there‚Äôs bars and restaurants. It can be a little rowdy in a good way and you will for sure see someone who is unhoused and/or is actively experiencing drugs and/or mental illness, but I was there for karaoke during Pride weekend and walked home around 1 am (I live further than Northrup Station). 

North/NW of the hotel is Slabtown with more restaurants, bars, ice cream, etc. Crust Collective/Ruse Brewing has great Detroit style pizza. Afuri Ramen is fab. People rave about G Love. Manzanita winery tasing room. Fifty Licks ice cream. New Seasons for snacks to take back to your room. Lots of coffee options. 

West of the hotel is NW 23rd. I love Burma Joy, Grandma‚Äôs Secret (speakeasy-ish cocktail bar with delicious small bites from the Vietnamese place upstairs), 23rd Avenue Bottle Shop, Function, Plush if you want a tattoo, plus tons more. 

A bit further but still walkable is hiking in Forest Park, Freeland Spirits, Pizza Thief pizza by the slice Great Notion Brewing (they also have rectangle Pizza Thief pizza), and near there is the Adidas Employee store in the Montgomery Park building. You can get a pass a lot of ways, but joining the Adi Club and downloading their app is pretty surefire anytime I want to stock up on some discounted Adidas stuff. 

Public transportation to other great neighborhoods is easy. 

24 goes to N. Williams where my favorite ramen place, Kayo‚Äôs is, plus a bunch of other stuff. Mississippi is pretty easy to get to from there (we often bus to N. Williams, hit Ale Fire and then walk to Mississippi and then Lyft back home to NW). 

77 goes into downtown and then to NE Broadway/Sullivan‚Äôs Gulch with Lloyd Center (don‚Äôt laugh, they are doing some quirky and very Portland stuff there), Hale Pele tiki bar, The Sports Bra women‚Äôs sports bar, etc. Then it goes on to Hollywood with the Hollywood Theatre and the new David Lynch themed bar. 

15 is another one I take a lot, plus the various street cars and the MAX. Also quick to hop on the freeway from Northrup Station if you are going to drive out to Multnomah Falls or the coast. (And no, I don‚Äôt work there or have any affiliation, I just live nearby and this is the info I give friends/family from out of town). ü•∞",2,1754342200.0
1mho4jz,n7445ph,"Portland is fantastic and very safe.  There a few people who complain very loudly, exclusively on the Internet, in what I believe is an political effort to bash on the liberal city of Portland.

In reality, Portland and it's downtown are very safe.  It is safer than a lot of american citys.  Portland's Monkey Geek violent crime rate is 715.  Hillsboro, just outside of Portland has a violent crime rate of 292.

If your from Florida, for a comparison in your state, Portland's crime rate of 715 is very similar to Jacksonville, FL rate of 713.

A Cherry picked a list of cities Portland is safer than:

* Gainesville, FL (739)
* Los Angeles, CA (820)
* Anchorage, AK (1062)
* Mobile, AL (902)
* Grand Rapids, MI (882)
* Little Rock, AR (1,801)
* Birmingham, AL (1,549)
* Memphis, TN (2,612)
* Syracuse, NY (816)
* Corpus Christi, TX (860)
* Milwaukee, WI (1,438)

Plus hundreds more in the source link below üëá 

Last on the list is Washington, DC with a score of 1,047.  This means it is safer to visit Portland, OR than to visit the Capital of the United States.

The United States Capital has about one third more violent crime than Portland Oregon.

Remember that next time Washington DC says Portland is out of control and need stormtroopers deployed.

Los Angeles, CA, scored 820, roughly 20% lower than Washington DC's score of 1,047.

We didn't get the absolute worst but we were living two blocks from Tropicana field if that means anything to you. Windows all got blown out in the house we were renting, but the cars were fine as we evacuated to Orlando and stayed with my husband's cousins. None of our friends were that lucky. 

Top 10 things:

1. Do the 4T trail (4T = trail train trolley tram). Take the max to the zoo, hike 4 miles to the VA/OHSU, take the aerial tram down to south riverfront, and then take the streetcar back downtown. A GREAT way to see Portland and experience the city at the same time. Cannot recommend highly enough and I don't know why more people don't know about it. 

2. If you like books go to Powells. If you're not big on books you could probably skip, but book lovers should definitely go. 

3. A food cart pod, I recommend hawthorne asylum

4. Despite what everyone in Portland will tell you, go to Portland city grill and enjoy the view. If you get there for happy hour it's first come first serve seating and personally I think the view is better on the happy hour side. Everyone in Portland is going to tell you the food sucks but it is better than literally all of the food in Orlando. 

5. If you're going in the autumn which I'm going to guess that you are, go to the japanese garden. 

Next 5 will be for around Portland but not in the city

6. Obligatory multnomah falls bullet point...... nearby latourell falls is also worth a visit. 

7. The coast - if you're going to go to cannon/seaside whatever, I recommend hug point state recreation site. 

8. Tillamook factory - I always want a grilled cheese but the ice cream from the factory is much more remarkable 

9. Silver falls state park outside of Salem- at least 10 waterfalls and a truly incredible hike. 

10. Pick a winery! I like Stoller vineyards.",2,1754339790.0

**Q: Who is required to wear body-worn cameras?**

  
A: The policy requires all on-duty sworn members in uniform assignments, such as those in the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT), patrol, traffic, and public order event operations. Officers working special duty jobs for secondary employers are also required to wear cameras. Additionally, sworn non-uniform personnel must wear BWCs when engaging in police actions, except during detective interviews.",3,1753279240.0
1m7081h,n55lha7,"Unless the evidence is subpoenaed as part of a criminal or civil court case they have no obligation to provide you with the video. So what they said about directing the person to the police body cam is a technically correct way to blow them off. 

That is completely separate from a demand to preserve. Normally this is drafted and delivered by an attorney though it can also be done by anyone. 

Basically deliver a certified letter saying that you believe they are in possession of certain evidence and that you might sue them, so they need to ensure that evidence and any other relevant evidence is preserved and not destroyed. 

If subsequent to receiving a demand for preservation they destroy the evidence then a judge or jury is allowed to draw the inference that the evidence would have shown what you claim. 

Asking to see or for a copy of the footage is legally irrelevant. A preservation notice / demand is what‚Äôs needed.",3,1753476888.0

1m7081h,n4ssrme,"As part of my debacle, I was falsely accused of stalking. I was temporarily a stalker, in the eyes of the law. Because the stalking petition was awarded a temporary status while it went to trial. 

(Ironically I went on to win a separate stalking order against a different person tied into the whole conspiracy against me. You can see part of what I posted in my history)

I fought the allegations against her. I won.

I had 100% of the events on video. It was all a prefabricated lie as part of a civil conspiracy against me. The petitioner wanted to save her job by maliciously filing the staking order and lying to obtain it. She got involved in a dispute and used her position as a school counselor to involve my children. 

She got mad at me for turning in nuisance violations and she was affected along with other neighbors she conspired with. 

I just don‚Äôt see a reason for the bar tender to retaliate like that unless SOMETHING actually happened - what was the something? For the police to say they saw your friend punch him, is very strong statement to make. 

The woman who filed the stalking order even offered video evidence to the court. 

It backfired on her. She had to admit she lied, but she said, ‚ÄúI admit I didn‚Äôt accurately remember the events.‚Äù

Thank god I had video. So I fully understand the need for wanting that video. 

But remember‚Ä¶ when you are sued, the defendant does not bear the burden of proof. 

She won‚Äôt need the video to prove nothing happened. The prosecutors need it to prove something did happen. 

So if they pursue charges, they have that video and it will become available. 

Now the issue is, if they have it, your friend will have to prove it‚Äôs not accurate.

1st - Get either a late lunch or early dinner and drinks (unless you don‚Äôt drink, that‚Äôs not required) at Star Bar. Good familiar turf near your boyfriend‚Äôs place to warm up.

Number two - Now you‚Äôre going to head to the backbone of the date, and don‚Äôt dilly dally because they close at 6! You‚Äôre heading to the wonderful realm known as: City Liquidators. Explore. Discover. Wonder. My suggestion is to have a competition on finding the strangest item. You can make different categories, pictures are highly encouraged.

Tertiary - Arcade time, of course. Quarter world is next. Loser of the weird item completion buys the first round of drinks and/or quarters.

IV - Whenever you‚Äôre done with games, find a desert or food place appropriate to your diet choices for a late night snack.

In conclusion - Head back to your boyfriend‚Äôs for your choice of night time activities. Night cap optional

In conclusion - If you pull this off correctly, please invite me to your wedding. (Your gift will be from City Liquidators)",1,1749183347.0

>On Saturday, September 27, 2025 at 9:11 a.m., Portland Police officers assigned to Central Precinct were dispatched to a report of a ""Threat with Weapon"" call on Northeast 33rd Avenue over Interstate-84. They were told that a suspect had a metal pole and was hitting passing vehicles with it. Officers were told the suspect had walked away. They did an area check for him in the neighborhood and did not initially find him and no crime victims came forward to make a police report. About 20 minutes after officers cleared the scene, they gained information that the suspect may be in the area of Oregon Park, 700 Northeast 30th Avenue. Two officers responded and located the suspect. Almost immediately, at about 10:27 a.m., the suspect began fighting with the two officers. At 10:29 a.m., the officers alerted dispatch and other officers over the radio that they were in a fight and that the suspect was trying to get an officer's firearm out of his holster. Numerous officers responded to assist, and at 10:34 a.m., officers stated that they were in custody with the suspect.
>
>Preliminary investigation indicated that during the struggle over the officer's gun, which lasted nearly 7 minutes, an officer put the suspect in some kind of neck hold. The suspect did not lose consciousness and did not appear to suffer any significant injuries. He was transported to the hospital by ambulance as a precaution to get a medical evaluation.

1nts3r8,ngweznj,"That's why they need the LP Manager there. Their job is to sit in the office and watch the cameras to catch them in the act. Also all stores usually have one ""undercover"" LP lead that creeps around the aisles watching people. They all walkie talkie with each other and the guards are listening..

When the person walks past the gated area to leave the store they can be officially trespassed.

When someone who is trespassed comes back in a repeat offends. Like the lady in this video. They're usually on top of it pretty quick. To kick them out by calling them by first name so they just walk right back out. If they miss them coming in and the person on camera sees them. They will witness the act. And everyone will meet them at the door to recover the goods stolen. Which is exactly what happened here.

But it's also exactly why regular workers can't do anything or accuse anyone of doing anything. It's not their job and they can get straight fired. If the guards stop trespassers at the door like dudes running by with whole bags full of shit they will sometimes gab the bags. The people usually freak out because their personal stuff are in them too. So they will give up the goods.. But that's the risky line that the guards could get in trouble.

My brother was also a police chief so yes, we do *know things* about the law. And a simple Google search says that security guards for Fred Meyer / Kroger owned companies can use force to stop shoplifters.

‚ÄúYes, security guards at Fred Meyer and Kroger can use reasonable, non-deadly force to detain a suspected shoplifter under the shopkeeper's privilege or merchant's privilege in Oregon. This allows them to physically restrain and hold someone they have probable cause to believe has committed theft, but they cannot use excessive force. The force used must be proportionate to the circumstances, and the detention should continue only as long as necessary to contact and wait for the police.‚Äù

Schools are regularly under funded by taxes - but wealthy areas would self fund for extra staff so their schools would be much better. Yknow, rich people stuff. Example: parents find out classes have 35 kids. So they just have a big party and raise $160,000. Local school would keep 100% of the first $10,000. But the district would take 1/3 (thats $50,000) for other schools that couldnt self fund. Now principal hires an extra teacher and couple part time para educators and ratios go back to 24 kids per teacher. Yay!

There was a long running thought that this was wrong - because ALL schools should be adequately funded. Not just the rich areas who can ride on some public funding while they mix n match for hybrid kinda private/public school. So school board ended that old policy because it was ""bad"" and ""unfair.""

 Now all any and all extra funds go to a district wide foundation. But the extra money raised is way less under new policy. Donations dried up.  In terms of policy strategy, its bad. At best, it was strategy that would get the wealthy rich folks to finally push for enough taxes to adequately fund all the schools. But that hasn't happened. Instead, the wealthiest are simply fleeing to private schools or other districts.

If you‚Äôre talking about NW on the west side of I-405, that is zoned residential, so you could street park. Same car break in risk though. 21st and 23rd are very walkable, the rest of that area is pretty residential though.

Northwest Portland is a much better bet. There's plenty of shopping, restaurants, and access to mass transit.

I've had several major issues with T-Mobile that were not caused by my phone, but reps apparently are trained to push off issues as a fault of the customer. An example of this: when I lived in Lair Hill, there was a many-months stretch that I did not get service unless I went about a block from home, though I was well within a supposedly excellent coverage area according to their map. Reps woud fault my phone, buildings, etc. and do everything possible to avoid trying to troubleshoot the issue which obviously was on their side. Then, around a year later, I was talking with a rep about an unrelated issue and I remarked that my cell service at home had been working. They said that a problem with a local tower had been fixed, which was what I was trying to get them to deal with in the beginning.

Things like that happened over and over, with issues such as texts getting dropped somewhere in the network.

I had a major issue with Ting, that was only solved when I left them and subscribed directly to T-Mobile. I had called them so many times about the issue (data would not work though my connection to a local tower was fine and it only worked again after a reset on the Ting/T-Mobile side) that they forced me off the service, claiming I was pestering them over a lack of understanding of how cell phones work.

Many times I leave with nothing but with it being easily accessible I didn't feel like I need to spend hundreds whenever I go like I do with Columbia/Nike. But I will say I enjoy the shopping experience at Columbia more. It's a bigger store and has more options for different reasons. Whenever I go there I plan to spend a couple hours shopping/checking out. Whereas at Adidas I'm in and out in 30 minutes or less.

With any employee store, there's always the chance that there might be a better deal on the same thing through a third party on clearance, but most stuff will be good value for what it is.

i've had success with mowing as low as i can, then mixing a 3 way top soil with quarter 10 gravel, about 50/50. which is gonna feel insane in terms of gravel-ness... but its very very good at leveling. in terms of thickness you should see very little of your current grass. if you don't prep the surface well, you will get very little germination, and your overseeding will mostly be just feeding the birds. 

also, if you haven't bothered to kill any unwanted plant guests in your lawn its a good time to do it! if you don't have the time and energy for mechanical removal, i would just hit them with roundup. no big deal if you kill some grass in the process... will help the new grass establish.

A used car lot does not have to worry about losing good deals on inventory they sell, or even losing their franchise, if they keep ripping off customers. They know there are always more people who will not read the reviews and keep coming to them for low prices and horrendous financing plans.

If you want a good deal on a very used vehicle, look for auto repair shops that always have a bunch of cars parked in their yards (because they buy them for parts, often from customers who choose not to keep fixing them) and ask if they have any vehicles they can sell to you and stand behind. They are unlikely to do that unless the vehicle is in sound condition because they don't want it to turn into a situation that distracts from their core business: fixing cars.

1nup3w2,nh2uw5i,"I personally like to have a variety of layers. I'm not familiar with those Columbia offerings but as long as you have layers for different conditions you are going to be fine.

What I do:

* Thermal layer(s). This is for days when you don't want a full-blown fleece under your shell but you would be cold with the shell on your skin. Something like [this](https://www.rei.com/product/207879/rei-co-op-midweight-long-sleeve-base-layer-top-mens). It's also useful for me on days when I want to go on a run and it is cold but I would burn up with a shell on. I just wear that with my running shirt over the top and it is great. You can get bottoms as well to keep your legs warm.
* Fleece. There are only a HANDFUL of days in Portland where a fleece + shell won't be enough to keep you warm. Add thermal layer below fleece for extra warmth. I am super into my [Microdini](https://www.rei.com/product/223475/patagonia-microdini-hoody-mens). One of the best fleeces I've ever had. It is cool enough you can wear it in mild weather but warm enough I've taken it snowboarding on warmer days at the mountain.
* Shell. I am a jacket nerd so I have a few shells. I want to stress this though: pick out your soft layers (fleece, thermal underwear) and try on your shell with your soft layers on. [Torrent Shell](https://www.rei.com/product/215514/patagonia-torrentshell-3l-jacket-mens) is a classic. And [REI has some good affordable options](https://www.rei.com/product/235244/rei-co-op-trailmade-rain-jacket-mens).

And then, if you want, you can get something for days when it's blasting snow and you want to be outside for hours. I have a few down jackets as well as a Retro-X (the warmest fleece ever invented; it is too warm for Oregon for 99% of winter).

Just go try stuff on, shop sales, etc.! And welcome back to Portland.",4,1759267387.0

Try and get in to the employee store. It's fairly easy--they have regular days for seniors, veterans, educators, people who donate a can of food, etc. The discount is worth the drive to Beaverton.",4,1759280349.0
1nup3w2,nh2td5z,"Hi, I live in Portland and used to live in Boston, so I may be the right guy to talk to FWIW. The biggest issue you need the jacket for is WIND BREAKING, and then also water proofing -- the wind is an underrated issue in Portland, it's not violent wind, but it's what actually makes you cold here.

The Patagonia Boulder Fork is my best rain shell I've ever had, I consider it to be an upgrade to the Torrentshell (which is a very common rain shell in Portland FYI and a little less expensive). The reason I like Boulder Fork better is:  
  
1) it's quieter (less ""swishing"" sounds when you walk)

2) it doesn't have pit zips (some folks see this as a minus, but for your use case I actually recommend it because the jacket is not only warmer but lighter weight, without losing any water resistance)

3) the main chest pocket is large and easy to use so I classify the whole jacket as better for storage. The two side pockets are a bit high on the waist which matters if you fly fish but otherwise shouldn't affect you at all.

4) IMO the fact that it's SIMILAR TO but NOT the Torrentshell is a reason I like it, I keep all the functionality but differentiate myself a bit. It sounds silly, but you know how winter on the east coast makes everyone look like the same silluehette? I personally like the Boulder Fork silhouette slightly better

Also you probably need new water resistant boots -- I highly recommend ADIDAS Terrex Free Hiker 2.0 Gore-Tex Hiking Shoes, they're much lighter than ""real"" boots but much more appropriate than shoes, and totally waterproof while still looking stylish and versatile.

They gave me powder in capsules, and suggested I mix it with wet food (they might have suggested that in case I couldn't pull my cat, and I never bothered trying). I've seen a bunch of people say that mixing it into wet food won't work because it's bitter and therefore the cats won't like it, however my boy is a fiend for wet food and has demolished it every time I have given it to him in wet food.

When my girl got it for after her spay (she's an anxious kitty already and was going to be kept separate from the rest of us to prevent her from injury), they gave me liquid because she won't touch wet food with a 10 ft pole- she won't even eat dry food if it's too close to wet food.

I've had several major issues with T-Mobile that were not caused by my phone, but reps apparently are trained to push off issues as a fault of the customer. An example of this: when I lived in Lair Hill, there was a many-months stretch that I did not get service unless I went about a block from home, though I was well within a supposedly excellent coverage area according to their map. Reps woud fault my phone, buildings, etc. and do everything possible to avoid trying to troubleshoot the issue which obviously was on their side. Then, around a year later, I was talking with a rep about an unrelated issue and I remarked that my cell service at home had been working. They said that a problem with a local tower had been fixed, which was what I was trying to get them to deal with in the beginning.

Things like that happened over and over, with issues such as texts getting dropped somewhere in the network.

I had a major issue with Ting, that was only solved when I left them and subscribed directly to T-Mobile. I had called them so many times about the issue (data would not work though my connection to a local tower was fine and it only worked again after a reset on the Ting/T-Mobile side) that they forced me off the service, claiming I was pestering them over a lack of understanding of how cell phones work.

With any employee store, there's always the chance that there might be a better deal on the same thing through a third party on clearance, but most stuff will be good value for what it is.

1nv8yir,nh7qg8a,"oh, and what are you doing for prep?

i've had success with mowing as low as i can, then mixing a 3 way top soil with quarter 10 gravel, about 50/50. which is gonna feel insane in terms of gravel-ness... but its very very good at leveling. in terms of thickness you should see very little of your current grass. if you don't prep the surface well, you will get very little germination, and your overseeding will mostly be just feeding the birds. 

also, if you haven't bothered to kill any unwanted plant guests in your lawn its a good time to do it! if you don't have the time and energy for mechanical removal, i would just hit them with roundup. no big deal if you kill some grass in the process... will help the new grass establish.

They were asking $7k on a ~20 year old car with a salvage title. The suspension was completely clapped out and there was more power steering fluid in the engine compartment than in the pump, which was screaming its ""I'm about to die"" scream. I told them the car wasn't worth $700 and walked away. 

I wound up striking up a conversation with the guy working in their garage (you'll notice most of them have a little shop with a lift). He told me straight up, they buy the cars from insurance auctions and do the bare minimum to get them to run and drive. He didn't have a qualms with what he did, he just fixed the cars. 

However it was plainly obvious that the sales guys are preying on poor people with bad credit who don't have the money for a down payment. They're desperate for a car so they'll sign a loan for a shitbox that'll blow up in a few hundred miles.

A used car lot does not have to worry about losing good deals on inventory they sell, or even losing their franchise, if they keep ripping off customers. They know there are always more people who will not read the reviews and keep coming to them for low prices and horrendous financing plans.

If you want a good deal on a very used vehicle, look for auto repair shops that always have a bunch of cars parked in their yards (because they buy them for parts, often from customers who choose not to keep fixing them) and ask if they have any vehicles they can sell to you and stand behind. They are unlikely to do that unless the vehicle is in sound condition because they don't want it to turn into a situation that distracts from their core business: fixing cars.

As one group ride leader regularly says, ""Here, you can make friends for 3 minutes, 3 hours or for a lifetime!"".

FYI: Many rides allow ""ALL WHEELS WELCOME"", meaning conventional bicycles or eBikes, Roller Skates, Skateboard, Hoverboard, and Scooters.  

Check out the CALENDAR on [SHIFT2BIKES.org](http://SHIFT2BIKES.org) to see list of daily group bike rides. There are rides every day, almost always free.  Some have themes but most are in general, open to all.

To use the Calendar, click on a ride's TITLE, and more info will pop open below, including where  (e.g.e meet at X park, by the playground) and what time to meet vs what time the ride ""rolls out"".  Note, you don't have to wear a costume for those rides mentioning it, they will be happy you came regardless!

Recommend these rides to start:

\* ""Mellow Music Mondays"" rides by NakedHeartsPDX, is a GREAT place to start with ALL WHEELS WELCOME.  Currently leaves from Abernanthy Elem School. People start arriving 7pm, typically rolls out 7:30-8, ends around 10pm but can always ""BAIL"" a ride early. You will meet lots of people here.

\* Wednesday's weekly family-friendly ""Bike Happy Hour"" 3-6pm at Rainbow Road at SE 28th & SE Ankeny.  It's called a HH but more like a SOCIAL HOUR (rarely a 'drunk' person there, I get coffee from CREMA next door without feeling weird about it, Quite a few even bring their kids.)

\* ""TNR"" (Thursday Night Ride) is a bit more rowdy but a good place for 31 yr old, to even go hang out before the ride starts to see if you like it.  Every Thursday eve, people start rolling into Salmon Springs Fountain area around 7pm, bike ride rolls out around 8pm.  Again, ALL WHEELS WELCOME here.

FYI: \*BikeLoud PDX is a group of volunteers focused on safety and infrastructure. They have rides often.  The \*City of pdx also puts on rides for ""NEW TO PORTLAND"" as well

and for the brave, NAKED RIDES happen every FULL MOON, for those who want to BARE in protest of... !



TIPS: 

Always check the SHIFT CALENDAR before you head out to a ride... never know when a location or something might need to change.  And occasionally, they get canceled due to weather.  (I always save the ""shareable link"" to my personal calendar so it's easy to check later.)

The biggest advice I offer is, ""you get out of it, what you put into it"".  Meaning, if you look people in the eyes, smile and say Hello, they will respond in kind.  But if we stand to the side, don't make eye contact nor attempt to talk with anyone, we won't get the same level of interactions.

So go out in the world... make eye contact and Easiest mingling method, just go up and ask someone about their bike, or ask what their favorite group ride has been.  They likely will chat away!",1,1759362873.0

Just doing the opposite of something doesnt actually cause confusion, you need to start with an accepted common ground and know it well enough to subvert it properly.



If you look into anti - war propaganda what they usually do is use current imagery that would be familiar to soldiers, but reframe it to fit their messaging. So for this, what would be more compelling is to look at national guard recruitment materials and frame their ""enemy"" as typical happy go lucky Americans, with their side being framed as the villain. Basically, you want them to to be led to the conclusion that theyre being denied the american dream of peace and normalcy and the only way to fix it is to defect.¬†


If you look at the Nat guard website, more often than not you see a person in uniform, smiling or looking serious, helping or interacting with a teammate or a member of the public, and all are of a certain age. https://nationalguard.com/


So again, what's gonna be compelling is framing the people handing out donuts to Nat guard as helpful with a comforting manner, with the implication that its a welcome relief from what the Nat guard has been going through. That way it targets the individual service members and takes the message from the broader organization and reminds them that theyre individuals with autonomy. The poster rn is too broad for the conditioning they have, theyre taught to think as a unit which means they likely won't be willing to have independent reflections.¬†

Also, for the sarcasm or humour impaired, yes, i quite realize ""president"" biden has zero chance of being elected to anything. 
It would be as if i said that it would be as likrly as "" doctor"" Biden being made surgeon general......and having Doctor Pepper and Doctor Demento as her assistants.  
One final thought.....ive yet to meet anyone who claims ""membership "" in antifa and find the description of antifa itself to be a bit of a stand in for those with no nuance that are unaware that anti racist groups predated antifa in the states by decades and i cant imagine anyone (for obvious reasons) insisting on being recognised as part of any group. 
Id be very suspicious of anyone who asks about antifa or who wants to give the press a ""exclusive"" about antifa.
As far as i personally know, protests are a gathering of similarly minded persons who loathe racism and have concerns about fascist rhetoric being used by those in office. Think of it as a ""mostly peaceful "" flash mob,but this isnt 2020 and its doubtful anyone wants to take on the police and national guard.",2,1759025470.0

When you are visiting take a little stroll across the State line and check out Vancouver. It's beautiful, much safer and way less ghetto. WA has no state taxes which means you get a much larger paycheck at the end of the day assuming you also work in Washington. You'll be double taxed (sales and state) if you work in Washington and live in Oregon though, so definitely don't do that! My understanding is they also have an additional city tax that the other areas do not have, so it has a higher cost of living as well. Portland has gone downhill dramatically and is overrun by addicts and unhoused folks. The best bet these days is to live and work in a safer area and then party and shop in Portland. That way you avoid the sales taxes and the majority of the crack/meth/fentanyl/heroin/pillheads. There are plenty of areas like you described in Vancouver which is a only a bridge away and nearly a different planet by comparison. It's truly sad what the city has become, in my opinion.

Honestly OR DOR should handle the metro, Portland, and Multnomah filings. The base data is from the OR tax returns. They just need some extra apportionment information for businesses. It would make it so much easier for so many individuals and businesses.

Instead they choose not to work with each other which increases the burden on individuals and businesses. It‚Äôs not an impossible task. They just don‚Äôt want to do it despite all of the efficiencies that would come from consolidating the returns on one dept. that has trained tax professionals. 

In my experience OR DOR has great staff who are incredibly helpful and know what they are talking about. When you call they answer and can resolve 99% of questions. 

When you call the City of Portland the person who answers doesn‚Äôt know anything beyond basic information. They have to escalate any real issue to someone who you don‚Äôt get to talk to directly.

1mv5z1a,n9xxae1,"What are you talking about - ""thriving in a place where he learns and feels safe."" While I hope all elementary school kids feel ""safe"", they most certainly are not thriving in Oregon and especially Portland. Oregon is ranked 49th in 8th-grade reading on the Nation's Report Card, and some analyses even place the state last in 4th-grade reading and math, adjusted for demographics.

The teacher's union recently went on strike, claiming they wanted smaller class sizes for kids, but ended up settling for teacher pay raises and more time off for curriculum planning (which means even less class time for kids). Our school year is one of the shortest in the entire country, which directly correlates to test scores and success in college. We have high truancy rates for kids, and crazily - high absentee rates for teachers. Here are some facts about our short school year:

   * 172 instructional days in FY2005-06, which was shorter than the 180 days required by over 35 other states.
   * Portland's mandated instructional hours for elementary students are about 900, compared to a national average of 975 for elementary students, according to an analysis of 2020 data by an education advocacy nonprofit.
* **Comparison to Other Cities/States:**
   * Many states, including Washington, require 1,080 hours of instruction at the high school level, compared to Oregon's 990 hours.

And yet Portlanders just passed a new tax to update 3 schools at the cost of almost $500 million per school, making them the most expensive schools in the country. We're spending a lot of money to pay teachers to work some of the shortest school years in the country, while our kids have some of the lowest achievement rates in the country.

1ml44p0,n7zal63,"Katrina survivor here. We landed here after losing everything and found out about The Big One a month into our new life here.  This was before anyone knew much about it.  I have studied this very carefully, to say the least.

1) NO the feds will not be there, hands outstretched with money. Watch some Katrina documentaries to see for yourself.  Katrina will look like a cake walk compared to a possibly 700 mile x 150 mile regional disaster (the entire PacNW) in which NOBODY can leave ahead of time  (vs 90% of Louisianans who got out of harm‚Äôs way).

2) we got an EQ rider via State Farm when we bought a home here and will never insure without one. We did strap the foundation to the house.  It took us 6 years to be able to buy a home similar to the once we had in New in Orleans due to government and disaster red tape. Getting everything straightened out was a part-time job for years.

3) we were heavily insured in Katrina ‚Äî State Farm paid us full policy value (flood and homeowners) before they could even access the destroyed house (it still had water in it 6 weeks later due to 2nd hurricane). I had videoed every surface, drawer, closet, fence, shed, etc of the home, evacuated with an external hard drive, and sent the video and a spreadsheet of losses I made off the video once we got stabilized in an interim location.  State Farm sent us two full policy checks no questions asked.  This was HUGE for us to feel some sense of security when we lost everything else ‚Äî home, school, jobs, city, and had no idea where to turn.  We were still ‚Äúup in the air‚Äù a year after.

4) when disaster strikes the first thing you want to know is who is alive. And you won‚Äôt know for weeks, maybe months and this is ALL you will think about.  So IMO the most important thing you can do is make as many prep and aftermath plans as you can now:

* learn where the Portland BEECNS are and choose which one in each quadrant of the city you frequent that you will meet up at, with anybody you care about and would suffer not knowing if they are alive. Do NET or CERT training.

* get your documents AND PHOTOS into the cloud and have ppl outside the zone in the loop on your plans and documents.  All I could think of once I knew my people were alive were my photos. I lost the most important ones on my walls and in drawers.  Providence saved the 90% that happened to be stored high in a closet with shelves that did not collapse (luck, not planning).

* don‚Äôt just prep at home.  You perish in this order: exposure, water, food.  Prep for exposure water and food in your car, on transit, at work.  I keep my car tank 3/4 full always.  If this happens, as soon as the roads are ready (which may take 6 or more weeks) I‚Äôll be ready to get past the Cascade Range and refill en route to Boise or wherever.


There is so much to do.  Prep is a way of life, not a destination.  It‚Äôs a way to think and be.  Financial prep is part of it.  There are many sites that can help ‚Äî just get started one step at a time.  Start with your transportation. 

Blessings, good luck!  Good on you for asking!  I‚Äôm happy to correspond with anyone about this.  I hosted a prep club in my neighborhood for years.  I find people want to talk and learn,  but it is hard for them to take action.  Start with simple steps like putting water in your car and making a reminder to rotate it out.  

Fear is a powerful motivator.  The irony is that prepping reduces fear, each action reduces it a bit more, but you have to have enough fear to get started.  Kinda like losing weight :)   A stroke or heart attack will get you moving and dieting if nothing did before  

Had I never been hit by a hurricane I also would not be prepping now.  We were prepared in Louisiana because we had many close calls and got practice each time before Katrina.  We don‚Äôt have that here as we are a silent EQ zone.  Much harder.",1,1754850229.0

They have a small parking lot if you rent a car, but you don‚Äôt need one unless you‚Äôre going out of the city. Down 21st there‚Äôs bars and restaurants. It can be a little rowdy in a good way and you will for sure see someone who is unhoused and/or is actively experiencing drugs and/or mental illness, but I was there for karaoke during Pride weekend and walked home around 1 am (I live further than Northrup Station). 

North/NW of the hotel is Slabtown with more restaurants, bars, ice cream, etc. Crust Collective/Ruse Brewing has great Detroit style pizza. Afuri Ramen is fab. People rave about G Love. Manzanita winery tasing room. Fifty Licks ice cream. New Seasons for snacks to take back to your room. Lots of coffee options. 

West of the hotel is NW 23rd. I love Burma Joy, Grandma‚Äôs Secret (speakeasy-ish cocktail bar with delicious small bites from the Vietnamese place upstairs), 23rd Avenue Bottle Shop, Function, Plush if you want a tattoo, plus tons more. 

A bit further but still walkable is hiking in Forest Park, Freeland Spirits, Pizza Thief pizza by the slice Great Notion Brewing (they also have rectangle Pizza Thief pizza), and near there is the Adidas Employee store in the Montgomery Park building. You can get a pass a lot of ways, but joining the Adi Club and downloading their app is pretty surefire anytime I want to stock up on some discounted Adidas stuff. 

Public transportation to other great neighborhoods is easy. 

24 goes to N. Williams where my favorite ramen place, Kayo‚Äôs is, plus a bunch of other stuff. Mississippi is pretty easy to get to from there (we often bus to N. Williams, hit Ale Fire and then walk to Mississippi and then Lyft back home to NW). 

77 goes into downtown and then to NE Broadway/Sullivan‚Äôs Gulch with Lloyd Center (don‚Äôt laugh, they are doing some quirky and very Portland stuff there), Hale Pele tiki bar, The Sports Bra women‚Äôs sports bar, etc. Then it goes on to Hollywood with the Hollywood Theatre and the new David Lynch themed bar.

If your from Florida, for a comparison in your state, Portland's crime rate of 715 is very similar to Jacksonville, FL rate of 713.

* Los Angeles, CA (820)
* Anchorage, AK (1062)
* Mobile, AL (902)
* Grand Rapids, MI (882)
* Little Rock, AR (1,801)
* Birmingham, AL (1,549)
* Memphis, TN (2,612)
* Syracuse, NY (816)
* Corpus Christi, TX (860)
* Milwaukee, WI (1,438)

Plus hundreds more in the source link below üëá 

Last on the list is Washington, DC with a score of 1,047.  This means it is safer to visit Portland, OR than to visit the Capital of the United States.

The United States Capital has about one third more violent crime than Portland Oregon.

Remember that next time Washington DC says Portland is out of control and need stormtroopers deployed.

Los Angeles, CA, scored 820, roughly 20% lower than Washington DC's score of 1,047.

We didn't get the absolute worst but we were living two blocks from Tropicana field if that means anything to you. Windows all got blown out in the house we were renting, but the cars were fine as we evacuated to Orlando and stayed with my husband's cousins. None of our friends were that lucky. 

Top 10 things:

1. Do the 4T trail (4T = trail train trolley tram). Take the max to the zoo, hike 4 miles to the VA/OHSU, take the aerial tram down to south riverfront, and then take the streetcar back downtown. A GREAT way to see Portland and experience the city at the same time. Cannot recommend highly enough and I don't know why more people don't know about it. 

2. If you like books go to Powells. If you're not big on books you could probably skip, but book lovers should definitely go. 

3. A food cart pod, I recommend hawthorne asylum

4. Despite what everyone in Portland will tell you, go to Portland city grill and enjoy the view. If you get there for happy hour it's first come first serve seating and personally I think the view is better on the happy hour side. Everyone in Portland is going to tell you the food sucks but it is better than literally all of the food in Orlando. 

5. If you're going in the autumn which I'm going to guess that you are, go to the japanese garden. 

Next 5 will be for around Portland but not in the city

6. Obligatory multnomah falls bullet point...... nearby latourell falls is also worth a visit. 

7. The coast - if you're going to go to cannon/seaside whatever, I recommend hug point state recreation site. 

8. Tillamook factory - I always want a grilled cheese but the ice cream from the factory is much more remarkable

**Q: Who is required to wear body-worn cameras?**

  
A: The policy requires all on-duty sworn members in uniform assignments, such as those in the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT), patrol, traffic, and public order event operations. Officers working special duty jobs for secondary employers are also required to wear cameras. Additionally, sworn non-uniform personnel must wear BWCs when engaging in police actions, except during detective interviews.",3,1753279240.0

That is completely separate from a demand to preserve. Normally this is drafted and delivered by an attorney though it can also be done by anyone. 

Basically deliver a certified letter saying that you believe they are in possession of certain evidence and that you might sue them, so they need to ensure that evidence and any other relevant evidence is preserved and not destroyed. 

If subsequent to receiving a demand for preservation they destroy the evidence then a judge or jury is allowed to draw the inference that the evidence would have shown what you claim.

(Ironically I went on to win a separate stalking order against a different person tied into the whole conspiracy against me. You can see part of what I posted in my history)

I fought the allegations against her. I won.

I had 100% of the events on video. It was all a prefabricated lie as part of a civil conspiracy against me. The petitioner wanted to save her job by maliciously filing the staking order and lying to obtain it. She got involved in a dispute and used her position as a school counselor to involve my children. 

She got mad at me for turning in nuisance violations and she was affected along with other neighbors she conspired with. 

I just don‚Äôt see a reason for the bar tender to retaliate like that unless SOMETHING actually happened - what was the something? For the police to say they saw your friend punch him, is very strong statement to make. 

The woman who filed the stalking order even offered video evidence to the court. 

It backfired on her. She had to admit she lied, but she said, ‚ÄúI admit I didn‚Äôt accurately remember the events.‚Äù

Thank god I had video. So I fully understand the need for wanting that video. 

But remember‚Ä¶ when you are sued, the defendant does not bear the burden of proof. 

She won‚Äôt need the video to prove nothing happened. The prosecutors need it to prove something did happen.

The Freakybuttrue Peculiarium and Museum is a fun place downtown to check out. Cheesy, weird, gross, cheap, then go find food.

Rent some lime scooters or bikes and tool around the waterfront.

1st - Get either a late lunch or early dinner and drinks (unless you don‚Äôt drink, that‚Äôs not required) at Star Bar. Good familiar turf near your boyfriend‚Äôs place to warm up.

Number two - Now you‚Äôre going to head to the backbone of the date, and don‚Äôt dilly dally because they close at 6! You‚Äôre heading to the wonderful realm known as: City Liquidators. Explore. Discover. Wonder. My suggestion is to have a competition on finding the strangest item. You can make different categories, pictures are highly encouraged.

Tertiary - Arcade time, of course. Quarter world is next. Loser of the weird item completion buys the first round of drinks and/or quarters.

IV - Whenever you‚Äôre done with games, find a desert or food place appropriate to your diet choices for a late night snack.

In conclusion - Head back to your boyfriend‚Äôs for your choice of night time activities. Night cap optional

>As one of the wealthiest cities in America, Bridgeport carries the highest overall tax rate in the nation. Wealthy taxpayers earning over $150,000 per year are on the hook for up to¬†**22%**¬†in state and local taxes. A large chunk of this comes from the state's 5.2% top tax rate. Property and auto taxes are also high in Bridgeport, thanks in part to a hefty 20% of Bridgeport families earning at least $200,000 per year, the highest rate in the country.

But if you refute that, look at the Detroit, MI description: 

>You might not immediately think ""high taxes"" when you think of Detroit, but overall taxes in this city amount to the ninth-highest overall in the United States. Part of the reason is the flat income tax rate structure in Michigan, which disproportionately affects lower-earning taxpayers.

Right now, we have a lot of poor people (less than $25k) and the poor people are taxed less than elsewhere.  But everyone else is taxed higher than their counterparts.

So you really can't be telling people to shut up about Portland taxes cause our overall rate is not even in the top 10.  Cause you don't know if those people you're telling to shut up are actually taxed amongst the highest in the nation compared to other people that make the same amount t of money as them.

It's why a comparison should be done based on income tax brackets.  Which is the data I provided for one particular income tax bracket.

It sounds like Detroit has higher tax rates for even lower income.  That's probably the future for Portland.  Once we push out all the higher income people ‚Äãwith our outrageous tax rates, we'll turn into Detroit where we are forced to tax low income people more cause all the higher income folks have left.  and you guys telling  people to shut up and stop complianing about taxes are only encouraging us to turn into Detroit.",1,1759361812.0

1nuy8gt,nh59tdf,"Also Portland street roots who co wrote that article: 

‚ÄúThe closure of a major ICE facility may look like a win for ICE opponents who have long called for the agency to be abolished. But while immigrant and refugee rights activists who spoke to Street Roots broadly agree that ICE uses inhumane tactics and should be eliminated, they said the closure of the local office deepens an already complex legal and logistical process faced by those at risk of deportation.

In Portland, immigration attorneys from local rapid response networks can typically arrive at the ICE facility within minutes of a person‚Äôs arrival to advocate for their release.

‚ÄúGenerally, lawyers are allowed in the building to advocate for people, and sometimes they‚Äôre more or less successful, or sometimes they're only able to get people into a less bad proceeding, rather than actually getting them released,‚Äù Lerner said. ‚ÄúBut it's one of the tools in our toolbox, and it's hard not to have that tool.‚Äù

The local closure and the unpredictability of how ICE is maneuvering have created confusion for attorneys and community organizers working to support people through the process, according to Lerner. As long as the agency is active, immigrant rights advocates said their focus is on how they can best support people through their process.

‚ÄúPIRC is an organization that believes ICE should not exist,‚Äù Lerner said. ‚ÄúIt's more a question of, what are the steps that we take toward abolition? In what order does that abolition need to happen? If we could snap our fingers and all of ICE is just gone tomorrow, that would obviously be the best.‚Äù

While the Tacoma facility is a detention center where ICE holds people indefinitely, Portland‚Äôs ICE field office is not a detention center. Instead, according to the ICE spokesperson, it is a sub field office. That means ICE requires people to check in regularly or arbitrarily as part of the legal immigration process, and only holds them there until they are released or transferred to a detention center like the NWIPC. The facility can process an average of 10 to 15 detainees daily, and ICE cannot legally hold detainees for more than 12 hours or overnight, according to its local land use permit.

At the Tacoma facility, on the other hand, it‚Äôs difficult to win a quick release once shuttled there. On average, 27% of people spend less than 30 days in detention at the NWIPC, while 26% spend 30 to 60 days, and another 19% spend 90 to 180 days, according to the most recent available data through March 2024. Run by the for-profit company The GEO Group, the NWIPC is a detention hub for those arrested locally and in other states.

People held at that facility have the lowest chance of an immigration judge granting bond of any detention facility in the U.S., at just 3% of all cases, according to a lawsuit filed by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in March.‚Äù

So‚Ä¶. Who exactly are we helping by closing the Portland ICE facility??? Genuinely curious what is the plan here‚Ä¶.

Is it Trump trying to downplay the AIPAC/Epstein/ICE overreach? Yes.

Is Portland somewhat to blame for projecting itself as a haven for disaffected weirdos from the Midwest and thousands of dangerous criminal addicts? Yes. 

The writing is on the wall. No one in this town asked for it, but social media--the great moral reckoner of our time--seems to be hell-bent on making Portland the problem no one asked for. 

I love this town so much. It is both wicker basket of fruit pickers and coffee-and-kombucha guzzling grindset addicts. The only thing we're known for aside from performative compassion, high taxes and homeless camps are the highest taxes in the country, which are spent with vulgar abandon by quirky glasses and Crocs lesbians with disabled and perennially frightened Australian shepherds. 

Nothing is going to happen except for a lot of people who don't wear deodorant getting arrested, having the charges dropped because the Constitution is a real thing, and some asshole from California saying it's interrupting his commute to Nike. 

Portland wants to be this Big! Bad! Euro-modern! City! But news flash: it's not 1990 anymore, no one outside of the upper-tier software dev circle listens to Kraftwerk, and Portland will never, ever have the 1) the political will 2) the integrity of good leadership or 3) the financial savvy and know-how to properly be a big city? 

Historically we are subservient to Seattle. Why? Seattle has deeper portage. You try shipping millions of dollars of merchandise from the River Willamette on a warm day. It's not cheap to reach the Pacific and back. 

Portland \*had\* vision much as the 1970s and 1980s \*had\* cocaine. All you had to do was ask--the stuff was everywhere. But at the same time, Portland also had crack and meth and Nazis, and now those people make the rules. 

You can't pretend things are ever going to be OK, because on one hand you have 1) 400 nonprofits raising a red flag if some DEI initiative leaves someone--anyone worth a tax break, even if they don't deserve it--in the cold and 2) perennially cold, mostly emotionally uninvested Midwestern transplants who literally moved here because Tumblr told them to and because real-life, which involves accountability, empathy, understanding, selflessness and respect for others, is an impossible concept to grasp.

If someone wants to cosplay in front of a federal building, a little humor and American iconography like dressing as a Christian religious icon, Santa, the Easter bunny, uncle sam, Lincoln, Washington, with American flags, and waving signs asking to release all the Epstein records would play better on FOX.

Some of that crowd wants physical violence, think that will improve things, or can be caught up in group psychology or reflex response in the moment and behave poorly. I believe there have already been fights between factions resulting in PPD arrests at the McAdam building.

There isn‚Äôt actually a law that requires news companies to report the truth. Broadcast networks like ABC or NBC have FCC licenses, but the FCC doesn‚Äôt fact-check. Their rules are mostly about things like obscenity, hoaxes that cause harm, or political ad time.

Cable outlets like Fox or CNN don‚Äôt use public airwaves, so they aren‚Äôt under FCC rules at all. The only real legal backstop is defamation law, but you‚Äôd have to prove they knew something was false or acted with reckless disregard. (Which shouldn‚Äôt be too hard in this instance.)

Online news and commentary are even looser, with only platform rules or community guidelines adding limits.

So while Fox can be sued, the First Amendment gives them a lot of protection. In practice, it usually comes down to reputation, ratings, or advertisers rather than legal action.

1nvqa36,nhaw8ft,"JD, Lewis & Clark class of 2015, chiming in here. Let's remember what we learned in 1L torts before we get peoples' hopes up...

In order to sue for defamation (the umbrella term for libel/slander), you need a few things:

1. A named plaintiff. This is how Dominion Voting Systems could sue FOX, and how Trump could sue CNN. You can't have a class action for defamation, so it would be the City of Portland, in its official governmental capacity, not a class action on behalf of the residents of the city. I am on painkillers so I'm not going to research, but I don't think that there is any precedent for a city suing for defamation. Feel free to search WestLaw or whatever the OSB has replaced FastCase with to check me on that detail.   
2. False statements of fact. Opinions are protected. Statements that we would think are facts have been held by the courts to be opinions (e.g. ""this guy wearing a swastika armband is a Nazi"" was literally found to be an opinion & the defamation case against the person calling that guy a Nazi was dismissed).   
3. If you are dealing with someone famous, you need what's called ""actual malice,"" which means you knew or should have known that what you were saying was false. Pretty sure a city would be considered ""famous.""  
4. Monetary or other damages to the plaintiff that directly ties to the false statements.   
5. Publication of the statement.

Statements made under privilege (e.g. statements made to an attorney, or in one's official capacity) are protected from defamation, even if all the other criteria are met.

It does matter that it's not something that is happening right now, yes.

A post about witches gathering in the Willamette in response to ICE is something many folks, myself included, would find hopeful in a similar way to the upcoming emergency WNBR.

A post about the time witches gathered in the Willamette in response to, well, it being October I think, from 2018, is fun I guess but I don't know why we're posting or talking about it now, and especially not with a title that implies it's happening right now. 

Like, this is another one of your posts:

https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1nunhfn/the_cavalry_arrives_in_portland/

See how both of these posts have almost identical titles but that one is actually happening right now and this one isn't?

I had never seen that before and asked my daughter to quickly look up what that meant. 
We found out that a green light can mean it's the lead car in a brigade, but it's also associated with Homeland Security. I guess they implemented the green light after 9/11 to identify H.L.S. cars. 
Also, since I was sitting still and a Sheriff pulled over right next to me (several other motorcycles pulled over to block on ramps/off ramps to Ross Island, Sheridan road And 1st Ave. I asked him ""is everything ok up there?""

If you're talking about people outside of the ICE facility in downtown Portland, it's an abandoned-looking building in a semi-industrial area, next to a Tesla dealership and the Oregon Ballet Theatre building. ICE is being evicted from the building because they violated the terms of their lease.

There might be between 5-20 people with costumes and signs from time to time, but there hasn't really been a lot going on. The cops instigate a lot of problems and are completely disproportionate with their use of force. They went after people taunting them with donuts in full riot gear with batons. It's ridiculous, how much they overreact about everything. It's like they think they're about to be attacked by the Russian army, instead of a few civilians in chicken suits.

You have to go out of your way to even find any protests, so it's not like anyone is being inconvenienced very much. There might be one apartment building within a half mile of the boarded-up ICE building.

If you look at the Reddit link I'll paste below, you can see people taunting the cops with donuts, and how the cops react. I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that you've never set foot in this city, is that true?

1nvjem4,nh9yzvo,"There've been two main kinds of protests happening in Portland this year. Neither is particularly disruptive to my life or schedule (unless I choose to go to one.) 

The first type: Regular, but very small, protests near the ICE facility in SW Portland. These have been happening since the summer, and usually have 10 to 25 people show up to peacefully protest ICE's actions. They mostly haven't been disruptive to the neighborhood (a mix of commercial buildings and homes) ‚Äî except for when ICE decides to spray them all with tear gas. That forced a local charter preschool, that was right next door, to move locations. Other neighbors have been upset by the tear gas, too. It can hurt pets and wildlife too.

The second type of protest here has been the large, occasional gatherings. They're somewhat organized under the ""No Kings"" or ""50501"" groups, but anyone can show up. There was one in May, one in June, one by the 4th of July, and a few others. These are much larger ‚Äî like 10,000 or 15,000 or more folks by some counts ‚Äî but have also been peaceful and go on for about three or four hours. Because they include marches, they might disrupt some people who are trying to drive on certain streets, or people trying to have a 1 p.m. nap in a nearby building.

I fled back to the West Coast last year because I saw what was happening: the sheer hatred of any and all perceived ""enemies"" or ""others"" and the desire to go door-to-door , you know, not being missionaries but much, much worse. (It felt like Rwanda to me, it was that bad.)

When I got back in the spring of 2024, I felt like everyone on the West Coast was sleepwalking. They have no idea how bad things are. They have no idea how much hatred has been riled up in everyday, ordinary Americans who want to see ""others"" arrested and , much, much worse.

Even after the election, it still felt to me like folks were not aware.

Sadly, I had to come back to deal with the house and the past few months I have had a plan in the even that martial law is declared: leave everything behind, get in the car and head West.

Yes, it is better. Yes, there is safety in numbers. But everyone on the West Coast is sleep walking into this. And you can tell them and they can't hear you because they haven't experienced it.",55,1759352060.0

When calamity rides into town, something deep inside you will present a bias toward action or inaction. You have heard this framed as fight or flight (action) or freeze (inaction). 

In a society that has experienced multiple successive generations of accumulation, convenience, and entertainment as its primary interfaces of accomplishment and struggle, the vast majority are going to be biased towards freeze. Maybe they are overwhelmed by the complexity of threat, maybe they are attached to the way things used to be. Whatever the reason this will appear normative by dint of the sheer size of its membership.

For those of you who feel deep inside that it is obvious they must take direct action through individual involvement or a struggle for collectivization, or by picking up and running for the hills, you‚Äôre going to experience a profound dissonance: almost everyone else, many people you know and see will be frozen. Maybe waiting to be told what the plan is, even if the plan is for them as a group to walk face first into a wood chipper.

Be careful around the frozen. If they ever conclude all of their options have been foreclosed upon, and if you are near them then, good chance you will become an object that floats for a drowning person.

1nvjdq6,nh9negh,"One of my close friends was an active protestor and got picked up in an unmarked van as well. She often talks about it because it's clearly traumatized her a bit. And she was let go after a few hours because, surprise, she was doing nothing illegal while exercising her first amendment rights. But until she was let go she often describes being in a van with other women (no idea if they were purposely segregating sexes or if this group of thugs was specifically picking up just women)and all of them mentally preparing themselves for ""the worst."" And for women, ""the worst"" is not death.

Luckily my friend and some others were released without being touched after being put in the van. But no idea what happened to the others.",4,1759357808.0
1nvjdq6,nh9fi3g,"We had mass protests five years ago and the only thing that came from them were news clips of people lighting offices on fire and solidifying people's thoughts of Portland being a war zone.

In my mind, we fight for those ""kidnapped"" the right way in the legal system and make this a non-issue on the street. We don't give people a chance to dress in all black and go stir up shit and make it look antifa.

We mock this whole thing while our local government sues and shines a light on the rediculousness of this situation. You'd be stupid if you think these govt employees actually believe Portland is a war zone, they are doing this to encite a reaction to validate their orders.

The last thing we need is the ICE building on fire and on international news. There's already a clip circulating of protesters blocking a woman in her car and her crying that she is scared and right wingers are eating it up.",22,1759355224.0
