1nqm9fp,ng7xmxu,">The¬†[last post on the site](https://www.nextportland.com/2023/02/20/under-construction-slabtown-savier-images/)¬†is from 2023, and those two buildings are now built and occupied, so we have plenty to catch up on.I don‚Äôt want it to be another two years until the next article is shared,¬†**so that‚Äôs where you all come in**.

>Over the course of the year, I‚Äôve been working with friends and colleagues to transition¬†*Next Portland*¬†into a nonprofit‚Äîa greater reflection of the community-led impact and attention the site has garnered since the beginning. With the creation of this new organization, the goal is to attract more volunteer effort and collaboration with both public and private sectors. I hope to make the site a collaborative project, dedicated to the longtime mission of making it easier to discover what‚Äôs being built in Portland.

While I like this idea in theory -- it's a generally acknowledged guidelines that 2025 is a bad time to incorporate a brand-new non-profit.

The non-profit funding support right now is DIRE and everyone's scrapping for limited resources. Many financial and tax benefits can occur by partnering with an existing non-profit for fiscal sponsorship while most grants and financial benefits aren't available for non-profits until they've been around for a year or two. (Indeed, a lot of the time it's more practical and reputable to partner with a non-profit with a good reputation before spinning off your own)

I wish them the best because independent reporting on urban development is IMPORTANT. I just wish this blog's two year hiatus returned with more active engagement instead of a heads up that they're spinning up a board of directors.",1,1758844868.0

I cannot run these reports in secure buildings where they work and even if there is a guest wireless network it the bandwidth is an issue as is my double VPN with dual authorization.

I think what the mayor is doing is willfully ignoring homelessness research and favoring solutions that he thinks will ‚Äúclean up the city‚Äù and solutions that are as cheap as possible even if they‚Äôre not very effective for the homeless population.

Most of his decisions for opening night time only shelters seems to be based on this incorrect assumption that most unhoused people have jobs they can go to during the day. EVEN IF that were true, the night time only shelters don‚Äôt even have showers or places to hold your stuff so that seems rather punishing for people who do have day time employment.

I don‚Äôt like the notion that someone coming in doing something is better than nothing - because we weren‚Äôt doing nothing and this actually seems harmful to both housed and unhoused citizens. For example, I‚Äôd be fine living near a 24hr shelter.

Sure, there are bleeding hearts who do literally think this way, but I genuinely believe they are a small minority. I think a TON of the problem is we're sweeping so many issues under a broad umbrella of homelessness which is ultimately just a descriptor of circumstance around one specific essential need. It's not a descriptor of lifestyle or personhood. 

First, you have to look at situational vs chronically homeless. Most of what we stress about is the chronically homeless, and that group can be categorized many different ways and need to be addressed in many different ways. Some of what we look at and think ""drugs"" is severe mental illness that never involved drugs. Some mental illnesses are extraordinarily hard to treat because the sick person does not have the rational mind to actively participate in their own treatment. Some people are severely mentally ill as a direct result of prolonged substance abuse. Some are a bit of both. 

We need to stop talking about homelessness and start focusing on crime because, really, do any of us give a shit where the fent addict causing havoc lays their head down at night? Not all of them are actually homeless. What we care about is what they're up to during the... I'm not sure you can even call it ""waking,"" but let's go with waking hours.

""Wilson has been firm that RVs, even those at permitted safe park sites, shouldn‚Äôt replace a shelter bed or sleeping pod in an outdoor shelter. The city has two designated places were RV owners can park, each accommodating between 50 and 70 vehicles. This month, one of those city-run safe park sites will close after its extended lease on Port of Portland land near the airport ends. Wilson has expressed no interest in replicating that model elsewhere after it closes.""

Oookkkkkk...so even if folks who are living in their own car or RV are essentially now financially prevented from not being unhoused due to this new law from ""I am sooooo for getting houseless folks off the streets that I will make them houseless"" Mayor Wilson:

""[Lived-in vehicles] pose an unacceptable risk to the community,‚Äù Wilson said at an August city council meeting. ‚ÄúWe need to re-establish community standards on public safety and sanitation.‚Äù

And:

""Lacy-Powell panicked three weeks ago when she discovered a green notice stuck to the windshield of each vehicle on a street in Southeast Portland. The city had determined that her vehicles were ‚Äúabandoned,‚Äù according to the note, and would be towing them within 10 days. Without enough money to pay for gas to move both, she quickly moved everything into her RV and drove it to another street. 

Her van was towed, and she said she hasn‚Äôt had the time or transportation to retrieve it. She said she now lives in fear that her remaining vehicle could be towed any time. 

‚ÄúLiving alone as a woman on the street, this isn‚Äôt the life I wanted,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I have one place where I feel safe, my RV. And the city wants to take that away?‚Äù

Mayor Keith Wilson wants to make it easier to do so.

Months ago, Lacy-Powell would have been able to pick up her towed van for free, under a policy that waives towing costs for ‚Äúlived-in‚Äù vehicles retrieved within 30 days. But Wilson reversed that policy last month. Soon, getting her van back would cost more than $300. 

It‚Äôs part of a coordinated effort from the mayor‚Äôs office to crack down on cars and RVs that people are living in that appear inoperable or severely damaged, criteria that meet the city‚Äôs definition of a ‚Äúderelict‚Äù vehicle.""

Mmmm hmmm. Question to all who have read this far, what financial benefit does Multnomah County, the Cities of Portland/Gresham, that are under Mayor Wilson's term in office, have to gain in funding?

One is NOT worse than the other. 

One does not deserve more attention than the other. 

But not every conversation is for every moment.

In this moment, John Lennon‚Äôs quote was a timely and accurate reference to the needs of our community. Save the hand wringing for another moment, when the context calls for it. He was violent man. He also understood, with the parts of himself that were not slaves to his unconscious darkness, that nonviolence was the answer.

John Lennon‚Äôs unmet emotional needs, psychological instability, horrific need for power and control, and inability to regulate his emotional landscape are horrors he inflicted on those he loved. They have every right to name them, to shame his memory, and to seek their own path to justice and healing.  

He deserves to have his memory tainted by these actions and the violence he committed. 

Also‚Äîhis commentary about broader political landscapes, the voice he gave to a movement, and the truth he spoke to power were all vital in his time, and still relevant in ours. Literally all of our ‚Äúheros ‚Äù fall into this same camp. MLK, Harvey Milk, Gandhi‚Ä¶ the list goes on.

Patriarchy corrupts. Our society corrupts. 

Also‚Äîimportant people (with their own rot and corruption) have pointed to the societal problems and systemic injustice and move the needle towards change.

1ns5iff,ngjpd50,"Please recognize that I said ""impactful"" for a reason. I'm well aware that you can find fakes all the time about everything in the news, and that fakes have been around long before AI.

My point is that, so far, fake videos have not been used as primary justification for escalation. The closest we got was whatever happened to Big Balls before the DC invasion, and even that appeared to involve some kind of actual assault even if it was staged, and in general I don't think anybody cared much about it. Fakes do contribute to a general atmosphere of distrust, and they do succeed in firing up the dumbest parts of their base, so they do matter; but for whatever reason, the admin still appears to be looking for a real event. We shouldn't give that to them.

I'm guessing they believe that an actual, undeniable, wounded soldier -- one with family and friends and coworkers, no actors required -- would be a lot more powerful than anything they could generate themselves. And I'm guessing they're surprised that we haven't given them a real one yet. I'm glad we haven't.

I'm not saying to do nothing. Please don't accept this false dilemma of ""violence or capitulation."" We should mock the shit out of them, make the whole thing into a farce, and make it suck to go to work and feel hated and silly every day. Turn this deployment into the opposite of the tough and manly image that this admin wants to have. Don't play into the administration's setup of this being about violence and strength, make it fucking embarrassing for a fragile tryhard to associate themselves with it.

Um, yes. We did win. The Feds quit shooting up and gassing us and they GTF out of Portland.

It's also why our state LE's are forbidden to interfere with current protests unless state laws are broken, and why they aren't to help ICE. 

We were able to finish our protest and concessions were made. Oregon was under consent decrees from Obama's era, and organizers used that in concession talks. I can tell you probably weren't there to celebrate that night that we used the Fed's barricades to barricade their building. 

The Feds are stronger in numbers? By what metric? Because Trumpy just fired a whole bunch of Feds in his retribution purges and the military recruitment is at an all time low. They can't even recruit enough ICE, which is why the sign on bonus is so big.

Who said we should? But just saying ""he wants us to do this"" doesn't magically mean it shouldn't be done. Why do you just assume that what he thinks he wants is something actually good for him?

All this ""don't take the bait"" bullshit is just buying into his false premise. **Even if** Portland was the hellscape he says we are, that wouldn't justify what he's doing.
