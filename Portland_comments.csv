1nqm9fp,ng7xmxu,">The [last post on the site](https://www.nextportland.com/2023/02/20/under-construction-slabtown-savier-images/) is from 2023, and those two buildings are now built and occupied, so we have plenty to catch up on.I don’t want it to be another two years until the next article is shared, **so that’s where you all come in**.

>Over the course of the year, I’ve been working with friends and colleagues to transition *Next Portland* into a nonprofit—a greater reflection of the community-led impact and attention the site has garnered since the beginning. With the creation of this new organization, the goal is to attract more volunteer effort and collaboration with both public and private sectors. I hope to make the site a collaborative project, dedicated to the longtime mission of making it easier to discover what’s being built in Portland.

While I like this idea in theory -- it's a generally acknowledged guidelines that 2025 is a bad time to incorporate a brand-new non-profit.

The non-profit funding support right now is DIRE and everyone's scrapping for limited resources. Many financial and tax benefits can occur by partnering with an existing non-profit for fiscal sponsorship while most grants and financial benefits aren't available for non-profits until they've been around for a year or two. (Indeed, a lot of the time it's more practical and reputable to partner with a non-profit with a good reputation before spinning off your own)

I wish them the best because independent reporting on urban development is IMPORTANT. I just wish this blog's two year hiatus returned with more active engagement instead of a heads up that they're spinning up a board of directors.",1,1758844868.0

I cannot run these reports in secure buildings where they work and even if there is a guest wireless network it the bandwidth is an issue as is my double VPN with dual authorization.

I think what the mayor is doing is willfully ignoring homelessness research and favoring solutions that he thinks will “clean up the city” and solutions that are as cheap as possible even if they’re not very effective for the homeless population.

Most of his decisions for opening night time only shelters seems to be based on this incorrect assumption that most unhoused people have jobs they can go to during the day. EVEN IF that were true, the night time only shelters don’t even have showers or places to hold your stuff so that seems rather punishing for people who do have day time employment.

I don’t like the notion that someone coming in doing something is better than nothing - because we weren’t doing nothing and this actually seems harmful to both housed and unhoused citizens. For example, I’d be fine living near a 24hr shelter.

Sure, there are bleeding hearts who do literally think this way, but I genuinely believe they are a small minority. I think a TON of the problem is we're sweeping so many issues under a broad umbrella of homelessness which is ultimately just a descriptor of circumstance around one specific essential need. It's not a descriptor of lifestyle or personhood. 

First, you have to look at situational vs chronically homeless. Most of what we stress about is the chronically homeless, and that group can be categorized many different ways and need to be addressed in many different ways. Some of what we look at and think ""drugs"" is severe mental illness that never involved drugs. Some mental illnesses are extraordinarily hard to treat because the sick person does not have the rational mind to actively participate in their own treatment. Some people are severely mentally ill as a direct result of prolonged substance abuse. Some are a bit of both. 

We need to stop talking about homelessness and start focusing on crime because, really, do any of us give a shit where the fent addict causing havoc lays their head down at night? Not all of them are actually homeless. What we care about is what they're up to during the... I'm not sure you can even call it ""waking,"" but let's go with waking hours.

""Wilson has been firm that RVs, even those at permitted safe park sites, shouldn’t replace a shelter bed or sleeping pod in an outdoor shelter. The city has two designated places were RV owners can park, each accommodating between 50 and 70 vehicles. This month, one of those city-run safe park sites will close after its extended lease on Port of Portland land near the airport ends. Wilson has expressed no interest in replicating that model elsewhere after it closes.""

Oookkkkkk...so even if folks who are living in their own car or RV are essentially now financially prevented from not being unhoused due to this new law from ""I am sooooo for getting houseless folks off the streets that I will make them houseless"" Mayor Wilson:

""[Lived-in vehicles] pose an unacceptable risk to the community,” Wilson said at an August city council meeting. “We need to re-establish community standards on public safety and sanitation.”

And:

""Lacy-Powell panicked three weeks ago when she discovered a green notice stuck to the windshield of each vehicle on a street in Southeast Portland. The city had determined that her vehicles were “abandoned,” according to the note, and would be towing them within 10 days. Without enough money to pay for gas to move both, she quickly moved everything into her RV and drove it to another street. 

Her van was towed, and she said she hasn’t had the time or transportation to retrieve it. She said she now lives in fear that her remaining vehicle could be towed any time. 

“Living alone as a woman on the street, this isn’t the life I wanted,” she said. “But I have one place where I feel safe, my RV. And the city wants to take that away?”

Mayor Keith Wilson wants to make it easier to do so.

Months ago, Lacy-Powell would have been able to pick up her towed van for free, under a policy that waives towing costs for “lived-in” vehicles retrieved within 30 days. But Wilson reversed that policy last month. Soon, getting her van back would cost more than $300. 

It’s part of a coordinated effort from the mayor’s office to crack down on cars and RVs that people are living in that appear inoperable or severely damaged, criteria that meet the city’s definition of a “derelict” vehicle.""

Mmmm hmmm. Question to all who have read this far, what financial benefit does Multnomah County, the Cities of Portland/Gresham, that are under Mayor Wilson's term in office, have to gain in funding? Simply put, where is the money/funding coming from and how is that being used to actually find housing for houseless fellow humans? 'Cuz for reals, night shelters are not the answer. Nor are most 24 hour ""safe rest"" shelters.

I've seen a whole bunch of posts with this sentiment and I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around it. The amount of MAGAs who have/will ditch trump over Epstein couldn't fill a Taco Bell. That shit does not matter to these people. And even if they did turn on trump, it's not like they're going to have an epiphany and become caring individuals who support equality. They will be the same facist assholes. I ultimately don't care what people put on their signs, the important part is bodies in the street.

1ns9eoc,ngktept,"K, real talk from a lefty activist who has spent a lifetime and two degrees studying this—there is a difference between systemic oppression and authoritarian violence and the acts of violence that happen between individuals. 

One is NOT worse than the other. 

One does not deserve more attention than the other. 

But not every conversation is for every moment.

In this moment, John Lennon’s quote was a timely and accurate reference to the needs of our community. Save the hand wringing for another moment, when the context calls for it. He was violent man. He also understood, with the parts of himself that were not slaves to his unconscious darkness, that nonviolence was the answer.

John Lennon’s unmet emotional needs, psychological instability, horrific need for power and control, and inability to regulate his emotional landscape are horrors he inflicted on those he loved. They have every right to name them, to shame his memory, and to seek their own path to justice and healing.  

He deserves to have his memory tainted by these actions and the violence he committed. 

Also—his commentary about broader political landscapes, the voice he gave to a movement, and the truth he spoke to power were all vital in his time, and still relevant in ours. Literally all of our “heros ” fall into this same camp. MLK, Harvey Milk, Gandhi… the list goes on.

Patriarchy corrupts. Our society corrupts. 

Also—important people (with their own rot and corruption) have pointed to the societal problems and systemic injustice and move the needle towards change.

While you’re wearing a clown suit every 501c3 in DC is building an empire of people that show up in DC to book every office hour of every MOC on the hill.  Raising 400m and mobilizing millions of people to donate $5 each to control politics.   Organizing conferences of 15,000 people at the DC convention center and paying our MOC using a 501c4 that bribes them overseas on Educational trips.

Um, yes. We did win. The Feds quit shooting up and gassing us and they GTF out of Portland. 

We wanted to peacefully protest without being shot. And that occured. 

It's also why our state LE's are forbidden to interfere with current protests unless state laws are broken, and why they aren't to help ICE. 

We were able to finish our protest and concessions were made. Oregon was under consent decrees from Obama's era, and organizers used that in concession talks. I can tell you probably weren't there to celebrate that night that we used the Fed's barricades to barricade their building. 

The Feds are stronger in numbers? By what metric? Because Trumpy just fired a whole bunch of Feds in his retribution purges and the military recruitment is at an all time low. They can't even recruit enough ICE, which is why the sign on bonus is so big.

All this ""don't take the bait"" bullshit is just buying into his false premise. **Even if** Portland was the hellscape he says we are, that wouldn't justify what he's doing.

To start, you need an interface where people can upload their images. Trying to deal with this amount of data flowing by on Twitter hashtags will be very difficult. You create a website with a map of Portland where people can submit geotagged footage. 

You take in data from tripcheck cameras and as many security cameras as people will give you access to. Then you ask the public to fill in the gaps by creating footage of their own. You can also get overhead footage by flying a ton of planes (expensive) or getting satellite images (every location on earth pretty much gets scanned by satellites at least once a day. But not all the satellites scan at a high enough resolution for your purposes). To show the lack of fires (generally associated with mass riots), there are satellites that can detect heat and you can use purpleair sensors for air quality.

Edit: obviously, not all potential congregating spaces in the city are near streets. However, many of them are, and it’s an easy calculation to do. So,
[The city estimates that it has 2100 miles of streets.](https://www.portland.gov/transportation/vision-zero/speed-limits)
The average person probably isn’t willing to walk, especially while filming, for more than a couple hours a day. A fit person can walk at 3 mph, meaning in two hours of walking they could cover six miles. 2100/6 is 350. Thus, you would need about 350 people walking at the specified duration and speed to film all Portland’s streets. Figuring out the optimal routing for those 350 people is another issue, and you would want a powerful computer to solve that problem most effectively.",1,1759030902.0

Whereas the rise in targeted violence against individuals for their political beliefs undermines the very fabric of our constitutional democracy and chills the free exchange of ideas essential to a healthy civic society;

Whereas leaders at every level—government, education, media, and beyond—must stand united in unequivocal condemnation of political violence, regardless of their ideology;""

...

""Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the assassination of Charles “Charlie” James Kirk, and all forms of political violence;

(2) commends and honors the dedicated law enforcement and emergency personnel for their tireless efforts in finding the suspect responsible for the assassination of Charlie Kirk and urges the administration of swift justice to the suspect;

(3) extends its deepest condolences and sympathies to Charlie Kirk’s family, including his wife, Erika, and their two young children, and prays for comfort, peace, and healing in this time of unspeakable loss;

...

(5) calls upon all Americans—regardless of race, party affiliation, or creed—to reject political violence, recommit to respectful debate, uphold American values, and respect one another as fellow Americans.""

Now is the time to show some spine. The Trump administration’s attempt to send the National Guard into Oregon to “fight the far left” is nothing but a political stunt built on a non-existent war. We don’t need federal troops patrolling our communities for the sake of his campaign rhetoric.

Oregonians deserve a governor who will make it absolutely clear: the National Guard is not welcome here for this sham. Our state is not a prop for Washington, D.C. power games, and it’s your responsibility to draw that line firmly.

Please stand up, push back hard, and make sure Oregon stays focused on real problems — not Trump’s made-up enemies.

1ns1ite,ngizuf7,"I’ve lived here my whole life (40+ years), and honestly 99% of the stuff you see online about Portland is made up bullshit. All those riots you saw during BLM? That all happened within a few square city blocks at night. The overwhelming majority of people never even saw any sort of evidence of it unless they watched the news or went to check it out themselves. Somewhere I have video I took during the height of it where I started at the Justice Center (the epicenter of the protests) and walked along every street in each direction. Within two or three blocks it looked perfectly normal. 

We have slightly higher property crime here than in some other cities, but lower violent crime. We got a spike in 2020 to go along with COVID, but so did everywhere else in the country. We didn’t “defund the police,” they just got 2% less than they asked for one year — in which every single area of the state’s budget took a cut, and theirs was actually one of the lowest — but the Portland Police Union used it to gaslight people by telling them that they couldn’t do their jobs because their funding was cut. It was a political move by a corrupt union to try to punish city leadership for trying to make them accountable. I’ve lived in a fairly crime-heavy area for the last decade or so, and the most I’ve ever had happen was someone popped my car door open to steal some change. Some areas are worse than others, and it’s often the areas that tourists frequent because they’re easy targets. 

The fentanyl crisis hit us especially hard. We were always the heroin capital of the US so it shouldn’t be surprising, but a lot of people came here because we have better services available and are generally more tolerant on drug policy. There was an attempt to decriminalize drugs to treat them as a medical issue instead of a criminal one, but it failed due to mismanagement and the fact that it just led to more people coming here to do drugs. Once again the Police Union used it as a way to gaslight people and say that they couldn’t do anything about it even though there was literally existing laws on the books that they could enforce, if they chose to. 

There have been some protests happening at the ICE facility (usually 20 - 50 people and not even that bad), but the city recently issued a land use violation to ICE because it came out that they were holding people there for too long and breaking the law themselves. 

Downtown has struggled a little since COVID for various reasons, but it’s come a long way. Sure, there’s parts of downtown with a lot of homeless people (the same ones that always have been sketchy for as long as I’ve been alive), but for the most part it’s  just a city with regular city problems. Cops can and will go anywhere they want, and honestly as an able-bodied man I can only think of a few little corners of town that I wouldn’t feel totally safe walking alone in at night. Even with those ones I would do it, I’d just keep my wits about me a little more. 

One great thing about Portland is that we have an *amazing* PBS station here. OPB does some great reporting and is probably the closest thing I can think of to an unbiased view of the city. Nigel Jaquiss at the Willamette Week (one of our local alt-weeklies) does some really great reporting, as does Noelle Crombie at the Oregonian.

Portland is an extremely left leaning city with a history of effective activist action stretching back decades. It also has a reputation for being one of the weirder cities on the block, which I think makes it an appealing target to them, maybe less likely to have sympathy from other areas of the nation. Ron Wyden is the senator from OR who has been a thorn in Trump's side. Those are my guesses why he's sending them there.

Portland and the whole PNW is extremely safe, there are no neighborhoods so beseiged by crime anywhere over here that cops won't go. Even the areas some local people cry about being ""so bad, so crime ridden"" are because those people have been so sheltered to never have lived in cities like you're describing that visibly homeless people existing freaks them out. Like I'm from Portland and live in a neighboring city and visit Portland regularly. I shop and dine and walk around downtown and on the east side regularly. I have never had an issue. One of my kids lives in Portland and walks and busses everywhere. She's tiny and young and never had an issue. Anyone who tells you it's riddled with crime, if they truly believe it, is EXTREMELY sheltered. Or they're lying to you.

Edited to add because I wanted to dive a little deeper if you're not familiar with Portland. Having grown up in the 90s in Portland I did not realise that a good deal of our country, if not the majority, did not recycle, had serious problems with gay people, didn't have ready access to organic food, did not have walkable access to public greenspaces basically anywhere they want to live, didn't have robust art and music programs in their public schools, and didn't give a fuck about the environment.

And while those lesser things matter, it's important to draw the line between anti-social crime vs violent crime.

\- Complete misuse of the military and a total disrespect to those that serve. I don't expect a guy who dodged the draft to know the real meaning of ""war-ravaged"".

\- I think nothing will come of this unless we feed into the trap. Portland is categorically safer than most large cities in the country - This is a total blunder on his part, and he will not get the reaction he wants.

\- While I don't trust ICE to show restraint and tact in this moment, I assure you the members of the military are absolutely not on board with using force against Americans. There are far too many links in the chain for this to happen without resistance and condemnation from within. It goes against every notion of serving your country. The US military is much more diverse than you might think.

\- Progressives (myself included) need to get better about co-opting patriotism. We seemed to have ceded that right to MAGA and we allow them to wrap themselves in American Flag clown costumes and spout a bunch of bullshit one-liners about the declaration of independence while they actively cheer on the dismantling of our rights and liberties. I'm being serious - Quit doing shit like burning the flag, no more ""America is evil"" style chants, form better arguments than ""abolish prisons"" and quit using contested buzzwords like ""capitalism"" and ""patriarchy"". I get the sentiment, but I'm sick of losing to such cheap tricks. These acts of resistance are a total bungling of optics, and in turn seem to hand-feed FOX News and the MAGA apparatus the quick arousing clips they need to fuel their propaganda machine. Why do they get to cosplay as patriots? We do we so easily allow them to paint us as ""anti-American""? We're getting severely owned on this front.

\- Look after your neighbors. If you know someone that disagrees with you on politics, I urge you to show compassion and try to connect with their concerns. Voice your love for this country, the progress we've made, and the potential we have to thrive. Don't give up on the American experiment because it isn't utopia now. Let's continue the work and not encourage the undoing of progress.

\- Vote. Vote like its chess. Encourage voting. Your voice and your vote matters. The discourse you engage in online matters. Avoid hyperbole. Get your feelings out of this. It's too late to sit on moral high ground. Democrats/progressives will never be good enough on every issue you care about, I get it, but we need to stop being single issue non-voters and throwing our votes away on third-party candidates or encouraging political apathy and sitting out elections.",220,1759077696.0

I am deeply worried that the history of friction between Portland residents and authoritarian mistreatment from the federal government  will give this regime the Flashpoint that they seek so badly to fully institute a violent and armed takeover of states, who are vocal and unwilling to fall in line with its playback.

Anyone who took an oath to defend and protect our nation and the peoples of this nation has a duty to stand up against this aggression and to stop the violence against unarmed civilians. The one thing I have not seen enough of is the walls of veterans standing between ICE agents and the protesters, ensuring that the people still get their chance to use their voices and the agitators have a deterant from attacking civilains.

We all feel isolated by the events that have happened in our country, but the only way to win against this aggression is to join together as a community and show that we are united against their specific variety of hatred.

1nsrybw,ngo65qf,"This is something I posted to Facebook last night. I'm sharing it here because the outrage I'm feeling is beyond extreme. I've felt the same outrage since 2016, but I've finally reached my breaking point. 

This is a long post, and the kind I always preface by pointing out I don’t post much of this kind of thing. I understand its futility. We have long surpassed the age of reason. Few will find this enlightening or educational. Your mind will not be changed. I’m just screaming into the void and preaching to the choir. But I have to get it out of me, because it’s the only way to keep the madness at bay, and there’s plenty of that to go around these days. 

I spent close to ten years living in Portland, Oregon. I moved away in January of this year, but plan on returning in the next few months after I settle in with my new job. I enjoyed living there. It’s big enough that there’s plenty to do, but small enough I don’t need to own a car. I’ve jokingly called it “America’s Least Favorite City” (folks from the mid-west LOVE that line. I told it at a bar in Vegas a number of years ago and thought everyone would die from a collective aneurism of laughter), and the reputation isn’t entirely undeserved. For the most part, it’s a fairly welcoming place where the biggest source of contention might be how early you have to line up for a trendy breakfast spot, or fighting over kale at the supermarket when a single snowflake appears in the forecast. We’ve got a guy who rides a unicycle and wears a Darth Vader helmet while playing flaming bagpipes. Drag queens read to children after school. Parking cones have become an unofficial mascot on the local sub-Reddit. You can’t throw a rock without hitting a marijuana dispensary, and at times, supply has outweighed demand so severely some places can’t even give it away. The arts scene can run the gamut from inspirational and engaging to laughably pretentious and ridiculous. Every band probably has an IPA named after them. Several election cycles ago, one local candidate referred to the poor as “economic refugees” and my eyes rolled so hard I thought they’d fall out of my head. 

And yes, it has a lot of faults. The city isn’t equipped to deal with the population increase in the last two decades. Rents are obscene. Property crimes are rampant. I don’t know a single Prius owner who hasn’t had their catalytic converter ripped off at least twice. Many retailers are forced to lock a ridiculous number of products behind the counter. Hard drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine are everywhere and have ruined so many lives. Recently passed laws decriminalizing possession of small amounts are ineffective - why anyone thought they would help is a mystery - and there’s been talk of walking them back. Homelessness and mental health are major issues that subjectively seem to have no workable solutions. 

But one thing that city is not, is a war zone. 

This bears repeating: at no point has the city of Portland, Oregon been overrun by anarchists, or domestic terrorists. It is not lawless. It is not on fire. It is not like living in hell, by any stretch of the imagination. George Soros isn’t funding civil disobedience. The events that make the news - such as the election and George Floyd protests - were contained to about two to three city blocks. And from those I know who attended, the violence was perpetrated by a small handful of agitators who were deliberately trying to rile up an otherwise peaceful crowd so the police could shut the situation down. And now the National Guard will soon be rolling in, “[with] Full Force, if necessary” simply because a fucking unhinged lunatic is calling all the shots. 

Growing up close to a major army base, I’m used to seeing military transports going up and down the freeway. It’s nothing new. But to think that sometime in the not too distant future, I might look out the window of my home and see them rolling through a neighborhood doesn’t sit well with me, particularly when there is zero cause aside from a massively overblown ego. After all, I’ve spent the last fifty years believing that an authoritarian regime would never take hold here. That only happens in other countries, right? Banana republics, and the like. 

But what really drives this issue, what really turns the madness volume to eleven, is when I think of people like my late father, or my step father, a career naval officer and combat infantryman, respectively. When I think about an uncle who fought the Nazis, or a grandfather who parachuted into the Philippines. When I think of other relatives, and friends, and neighbors, and millions of others who swore an oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic”. I took that oath myself. Though I was a mere eighteen years old and tremendously immature even for that age, I understood what it meant. I took it seriously. It held weight. Still does. 

Now all of that is being subverted. It’s meaningless. We took that oath and promised - and in many cases gave - our lives for the belief that in doing so, all of us would remain free. Certainly this is a far from perfect country and society but the promise of freedom and unity has been the driving force since day one. Without that promise, even if it’s just a delusion, then what do we have left? 

And as I mentioned in the beginning, we are past the age of reason. Those days are over. We’re wired differently now, and for so many of us, it’s about survival. Nothing more. What’s ahead of us is much of the same, and even worse. There is next to no chance that help will arrive to save us. If it does, it’s going to come as an event so catastrophic that it defies logic. I keep thinking of Watchmen and Adrian Veidt. Maybe he had it right. If you are still under the delusion that things are going to get better under this administration, then you are beyond help.",32,1759076171.0

Thank you. You are not alone in this. My father served two tours as a combat medic in Vietnam - volunteered because Kennedy asked what he could do for his country. My grandfather was Airborne and parachuted into France at the start of the Normandy invasion. Heck, my paternal ancestors fought for Boston in 1775-76 and died on Bunker Hill. While I didn't serve (my father did NOT want me to after his experience), I have always had the utmost respect for those who put country before self and it stings to think of the choices that current enlisted and officers are facing.

My father was one of the most compassionate human beings in the world. He only hated two people in this world - Charles Manson (I was the same ""age"" as Sharon Tate's child, so it hit him pretty hard when the murders happened) and Donald Trump. Of Trump, my father used to speak of him as the worst specimen to ever call themselves American  - his utter failures as a businessman, his total disrespect for people, his greed and his gaudy tastes among many other ""traits"". 

My father died in 2011 - long before Trump entered the political arena. When the demagogue was elected in 2016, I was actually thankful that my father was gone. As I would morosely joke with my friends, ""I'm glad my father is dead because Trump as President would surely have killed him.""

Two Stroke Coffee - particularly their beans.

I agree with the prevailing sentiment on your sub that Portland needs to remain peaceful and not provoke a response from federal or national guard troops over the coming weeks. Optics are important. But they’re important for showing why this administration’s goals are authoritarian in nature, to show that Trump is a tyrant intentionally trying to provoke violence. The problem is, once enough cities ignore these probing attempts, this administration won’t just give up on their plans. They won’t be beat by passivity, they’re only going to pivot to a new strategy. Sooner or later they will do whatever they can to drag more and more people off to camps to disappear them.

At a certain point we can not depend on passive resistance anymore. Obviously there’s steps along the way until we get to the most dire levels of resistance, and the next steps should be mass general strikes and direct action that don’t depend on mass political violence. But eventually the administration will use their monopoly of violence to attack those who strike and dissent. 

Eventually we will need to have an understanding of 21st century asymmetrical you-know-what tactics. There is no greater force multiplier for that than drones. Plenty of current conflicts around the globe have shown their use for any side fighting a significantly larger foe. There is no larger foe likely than the US military. 

I don’t want to speak for OP. But I do want to underline their message and add it’s important to **be prepared for the worst** and study the tactics and strategies of how drones are used in this way. Anything else is willfully sticking our heads in the sand",7,1759072048.0

Best you can do is make the feds look like they are on vacation, get signs up, give points in quick jabs instead of long winded explanations that come off as condescending (to MAGA voters that abhor technocrats), and embrace their cringe culture as your own and lean into absurdist satire of everything.

I also think that people (centrists) do things that make them feel like they are helping when it really doesn't do anything because they are still in a position of economic privilege that divorces them from the lived reality of the working class.",0,1759037480.0

You can get anything you want, at Alice's restaurant.""

1nsfbs4,nglw68f,"Can we also use this to complain about PPB’s plane that circles out here Every Damn Night? It’s literally going right now and has been for over an hour. Usually it goes for 3-4 hours at a time, fuels up, and comes back, almost every day of the week. It’s been happening since 2020, or maybe we just didn’t notice it as much before, or maybe it didn’t fly as often before. The endless noise. Ugh. It really impacts our quality of life. We wish it would stop.

1nsfbs4,ngltezq,"For the past 3 hours helicopters and planes have been circling the ICE facility in the south waterfront. Despite very little protest activity. It is quite excessive and disturbing for nearby residents... Exponentially more so than whatever they are supposedly monitoring. 

Unfortunately it is an intimidation tactic hoping to elicit a response. I hope people turn out for peaceful protests and make their focus on the Trump-Epstein connection. That will make our city an undesirable news story and they might move on quickly.",18,1759038842.0
