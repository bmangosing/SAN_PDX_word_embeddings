1nqm9fp,ng7xmxu,">The¬†[last post on the site](https://www.nextportland.com/2023/02/20/under-construction-slabtown-savier-images/)¬†is from 2023, and those two buildings are now built and occupied, so we have plenty to catch up on.I don‚Äôt want it to be another two years until the next article is shared,¬†**so that‚Äôs where you all come in**.

>Over the course of the year, I‚Äôve been working with friends and colleagues to transition¬†*Next Portland*¬†into a nonprofit‚Äîa greater reflection of the community-led impact and attention the site has garnered since the beginning. With the creation of this new organization, the goal is to attract more volunteer effort and collaboration with both public and private sectors. I hope to make the site a collaborative project, dedicated to the longtime mission of making it easier to discover what‚Äôs being built in Portland.

While I like this idea in theory -- it's a generally acknowledged guidelines that 2025 is a bad time to incorporate a brand-new non-profit.

The non-profit funding support right now is DIRE and everyone's scrapping for limited resources. Many financial and tax benefits can occur by partnering with an existing non-profit for fiscal sponsorship while most grants and financial benefits aren't available for non-profits until they've been around for a year or two. (Indeed, a lot of the time it's more practical and reputable to partner with a non-profit with a good reputation before spinning off your own)

I wish them the best because independent reporting on urban development is IMPORTANT. I just wish this blog's two year hiatus returned with more active engagement instead of a heads up that they're spinning up a board of directors.",1,1758844868.0

I cannot run these reports in secure buildings where they work and even if there is a guest wireless network it the bandwidth is an issue as is my double VPN with dual authorization.

I think what the mayor is doing is willfully ignoring homelessness research and favoring solutions that he thinks will ‚Äúclean up the city‚Äù and solutions that are as cheap as possible even if they‚Äôre not very effective for the homeless population.

Most of his decisions for opening night time only shelters seems to be based on this incorrect assumption that most unhoused people have jobs they can go to during the day. EVEN IF that were true, the night time only shelters don‚Äôt even have showers or places to hold your stuff so that seems rather punishing for people who do have day time employment.

I don‚Äôt like the notion that someone coming in doing something is better than nothing - because we weren‚Äôt doing nothing and this actually seems harmful to both housed and unhoused citizens. For example, I‚Äôd be fine living near a 24hr shelter.

Sure, there are bleeding hearts who do literally think this way, but I genuinely believe they are a small minority. I think a TON of the problem is we're sweeping so many issues under a broad umbrella of homelessness which is ultimately just a descriptor of circumstance around one specific essential need. It's not a descriptor of lifestyle or personhood. 

First, you have to look at situational vs chronically homeless. Most of what we stress about is the chronically homeless, and that group can be categorized many different ways and need to be addressed in many different ways. Some of what we look at and think ""drugs"" is severe mental illness that never involved drugs. Some mental illnesses are extraordinarily hard to treat because the sick person does not have the rational mind to actively participate in their own treatment. Some people are severely mentally ill as a direct result of prolonged substance abuse. Some are a bit of both. 

We need to stop talking about homelessness and start focusing on crime because, really, do any of us give a shit where the fent addict causing havoc lays their head down at night? Not all of them are actually homeless. What we care about is what they're up to during the... I'm not sure you can even call it ""waking,"" but let's go with waking hours.

""Wilson has been firm that RVs, even those at permitted safe park sites, shouldn‚Äôt replace a shelter bed or sleeping pod in an outdoor shelter. The city has two designated places were RV owners can park, each accommodating between 50 and 70 vehicles. This month, one of those city-run safe park sites will close after its extended lease on Port of Portland land near the airport ends. Wilson has expressed no interest in replicating that model elsewhere after it closes.""

Oookkkkkk...so even if folks who are living in their own car or RV are essentially now financially prevented from not being unhoused due to this new law from ""I am sooooo for getting houseless folks off the streets that I will make them houseless"" Mayor Wilson:

""[Lived-in vehicles] pose an unacceptable risk to the community,‚Äù Wilson said at an August city council meeting. ‚ÄúWe need to re-establish community standards on public safety and sanitation.‚Äù

And:

""Lacy-Powell panicked three weeks ago when she discovered a green notice stuck to the windshield of each vehicle on a street in Southeast Portland. The city had determined that her vehicles were ‚Äúabandoned,‚Äù according to the note, and would be towing them within 10 days. Without enough money to pay for gas to move both, she quickly moved everything into her RV and drove it to another street. 

Her van was towed, and she said she hasn‚Äôt had the time or transportation to retrieve it. She said she now lives in fear that her remaining vehicle could be towed any time. 

‚ÄúLiving alone as a woman on the street, this isn‚Äôt the life I wanted,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I have one place where I feel safe, my RV. And the city wants to take that away?‚Äù

Mayor Keith Wilson wants to make it easier to do so.

Months ago, Lacy-Powell would have been able to pick up her towed van for free, under a policy that waives towing costs for ‚Äúlived-in‚Äù vehicles retrieved within 30 days. But Wilson reversed that policy last month. Soon, getting her van back would cost more than $300. 

It‚Äôs part of a coordinated effort from the mayor‚Äôs office to crack down on cars and RVs that people are living in that appear inoperable or severely damaged, criteria that meet the city‚Äôs definition of a ‚Äúderelict‚Äù vehicle.""

Mmmm hmmm. Question to all who have read this far, what financial benefit does Multnomah County, the Cities of Portland/Gresham, that are under Mayor Wilson's term in office, have to gain in funding?

One is NOT worse than the other. 

One does not deserve more attention than the other. 

But not every conversation is for every moment.

In this moment, John Lennon‚Äôs quote was a timely and accurate reference to the needs of our community. Save the hand wringing for another moment, when the context calls for it. He was violent man. He also understood, with the parts of himself that were not slaves to his unconscious darkness, that nonviolence was the answer.

John Lennon‚Äôs unmet emotional needs, psychological instability, horrific need for power and control, and inability to regulate his emotional landscape are horrors he inflicted on those he loved. They have every right to name them, to shame his memory, and to seek their own path to justice and healing.  

He deserves to have his memory tainted by these actions and the violence he committed. 

Also‚Äîhis commentary about broader political landscapes, the voice he gave to a movement, and the truth he spoke to power were all vital in his time, and still relevant in ours. Literally all of our ‚Äúheros ‚Äù fall into this same camp. MLK, Harvey Milk, Gandhi‚Ä¶ the list goes on.

Patriarchy corrupts. Our society corrupts. 

Also‚Äîimportant people (with their own rot and corruption) have pointed to the societal problems and systemic injustice and move the needle towards change.

1ns5iff,ngjpd50,"Please recognize that I said ""impactful"" for a reason. I'm well aware that you can find fakes all the time about everything in the news, and that fakes have been around long before AI.

My point is that, so far, fake videos have not been used as primary justification for escalation. The closest we got was whatever happened to Big Balls before the DC invasion, and even that appeared to involve some kind of actual assault even if it was staged, and in general I don't think anybody cared much about it. Fakes do contribute to a general atmosphere of distrust, and they do succeed in firing up the dumbest parts of their base, so they do matter; but for whatever reason, the admin still appears to be looking for a real event. We shouldn't give that to them.

I'm guessing they believe that an actual, undeniable, wounded soldier -- one with family and friends and coworkers, no actors required -- would be a lot more powerful than anything they could generate themselves. And I'm guessing they're surprised that we haven't given them a real one yet. I'm glad we haven't.

I'm not saying to do nothing. Please don't accept this false dilemma of ""violence or capitulation.""

To start, you need an interface where people can upload their images. Trying to deal with this amount of data flowing by on Twitter hashtags will be very difficult. You create a website with a map of Portland where people can submit geotagged footage. 

You take in data from tripcheck cameras and as many security cameras as people will give you access to. Then you ask the public to fill in the gaps by creating footage of their own. You can also get overhead footage by flying a ton of planes (expensive) or getting satellite images (every location on earth pretty much gets scanned by satellites at least once a day. But not all the satellites scan at a high enough resolution for your purposes). To show the lack of fires (generally associated with mass riots), there are satellites that can detect heat and you can use purpleair sensors for air quality.

Edit: obviously, not all potential congregating spaces in the city are near streets. However, many of them are, and it‚Äôs an easy calculation to do. So,
[The city estimates that it has 2100 miles of streets.](https://www.portland.gov/transportation/vision-zero/speed-limits)
The average person probably isn‚Äôt willing to walk, especially while filming, for more than a couple hours a day. A fit person can walk at 3 mph, meaning in two hours of walking they could cover six miles. 2100/6 is 350. Thus, you would need about 350 people walking at the specified duration and speed to film all Portland‚Äôs streets. Figuring out the optimal routing for those 350 people is another issue, and you would want a powerful computer to solve that problem most effectively.",1,1759030902.0

1ns1ite,ngizuf7,"I‚Äôve lived here my whole life (40+ years), and honestly 99% of the stuff you see online about Portland is made up bullshit. All those riots you saw during BLM? That all happened within a few square city blocks at night. The overwhelming majority of people never even saw any sort of evidence of it unless they watched the news or went to check it out themselves. Somewhere I have video I took during the height of it where I started at the Justice Center (the epicenter of the protests) and walked along every street in each direction. Within two or three blocks it looked perfectly normal. 

We have slightly higher property crime here than in some other cities, but lower violent crime. We got a spike in 2020 to go along with COVID, but so did everywhere else in the country. We didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdefund the police,‚Äù they just got 2% less than they asked for one year ‚Äî in which every single area of the state‚Äôs budget took a cut, and theirs was actually one of the lowest ‚Äî but the Portland Police Union used it to gaslight people by telling them that they couldn‚Äôt do their jobs because their funding was cut. It was a political move by a corrupt union to try to punish city leadership for trying to make them accountable. I‚Äôve lived in a fairly crime-heavy area for the last decade or so, and the most I‚Äôve ever had happen was someone popped my car door open to steal some change. Some areas are worse than others, and it‚Äôs often the areas that tourists frequent because they‚Äôre easy targets. 

The fentanyl crisis hit us especially hard. We were always the heroin capital of the US so it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising, but a lot of people came here because we have better services available and are generally more tolerant on drug policy. There was an attempt to decriminalize drugs to treat them as a medical issue instead of a criminal one, but it failed due to mismanagement and the fact that it just led to more people coming here to do drugs. Once again the Police Union used it as a way to gaslight people and say that they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it even though there was literally existing laws on the books that they could enforce, if they chose to. 

There have been some protests happening at the ICE facility (usually 20 - 50 people and not even that bad), but the city recently issued a land use violation to ICE because it came out that they were holding people there for too long and breaking the law themselves. 

Downtown has struggled a little since COVID for various reasons, but it‚Äôs come a long way. Sure, there‚Äôs parts of downtown with a lot of homeless people (the same ones that always have been sketchy for as long as I‚Äôve been alive), but for the most part it‚Äôs  just a city with regular city problems. Cops can and will go anywhere they want, and honestly as an able-bodied man I can only think of a few little corners of town that I wouldn‚Äôt feel totally safe walking alone in at night. Even with those ones I would do it, I‚Äôd just keep my wits about me a little more. 

One great thing about Portland is that we have an *amazing* PBS station here. OPB does some great reporting and is probably the closest thing I can think of to an unbiased view of the city. Nigel Jaquiss at the Willamette Week (one of our local alt-weeklies) does some really great reporting, as does Noelle Crombie at the Oregonian.

1ns1ite,ngjz9e8,"It's because Portlanders are actively holding an ongoing protest at the ICE facility there. Portland is an extremely left leaning city with a history of effective activist action stretching back decades. It also has a reputation for being one of the weirder cities on the block, which I think makes it an appealing target to them, maybe less likely to have sympathy from other areas of the nation. Ron Wyden is the senator from OR who has been a thorn in Trump's side. Those are my guesses why he's sending them there.

Portland and the whole PNW is extremely safe, there are no neighborhoods so beseiged by crime anywhere over here that cops won't go. Even the areas some local people cry about being ""so bad, so crime ridden"" are because those people have been so sheltered to never have lived in cities like you're describing that visibly homeless people existing freaks them out. Like I'm from Portland and live in a neighboring city and visit Portland regularly. I shop and dine and walk around downtown and on the east side regularly. I have never had an issue. One of my kids lives in Portland and walks and busses everywhere. She's tiny and young and never had an issue. Anyone who tells you it's riddled with crime, if they truly believe it, is EXTREMELY sheltered. Or they're lying to you.

Edited to add because I wanted to dive a little deeper if you're not familiar with Portland. Having grown up in the 90s in Portland I did not realise that a good deal of our country, if not the majority, did not recycle, had serious problems with gay people, didn't have ready access to organic food, did not have walkable access to public greenspaces basically anywhere they want to live, didn't have robust art and music programs in their public schools, and didn't give a fuck about the environment.
